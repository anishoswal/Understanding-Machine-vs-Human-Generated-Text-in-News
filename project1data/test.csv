"Protesters add 'Defund The Police' to 'Black Lives Matter' mural near White House

During the week, Trump has made firing FBI Director James Comey a priority, and last week sent a letter to DOJ Director James Comey telling him not to fire him.

Tapur, a Republican, has denied he has had contact with President Trump during that time.

Multiple sources told Mashable that Tapur last week worked for the Obama administration and had done research into marijuana and marijuana products, specifically in Congress, but has never received any financial support for Trump.

""He was president of the United States and he needed to become the leader of his own administration. The fact that he decided to fire Comey was a powerful message, one that resonated with me,"" said Raman Khera of Canop, who is now working as a legal advisor.

""People don't like to know, so he got fired because he is a joblover and he went to work for some shady money scheme. Then, the next day, when he started looking into marijuana things started breaking out. They didn't love him as much as they did his counterpart or Trump.

""He was out of the country when it all started. No one ever saw that he was actually a very nice guy.""

A number of evidence, from his ethics review before the firing, has surfaced in this investigation. Some of them are highlighted by Joshua Weissmann, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Arnold Spitzer & Spitz, who says Trump has signed statements protecting his personal identity and numerous companies.",machine

"GOP ramps up attacks over efforts to defund the police: ?Democrats are insane? ? Amy Robach (@AmyRobach) 26 ?. Mizzou and Delray Beach, Va.

""We're on an unprecedented move. People need to stay away. This is already happening because we're working hard to protect us as Americans, no matter who they're doing it with. The Republicans have nothing more for us than to put the Trump administration in charge of our police.

""We're not even close to getting any of the things that are happening right, we need a real reform. This is already happening now: The way we do it, the way we do it is absolutely critical.""

As it is, Republicans are pushing back against Democrats' efforts to push through an aggressive agenda for the upcoming midterm elections. The idea has gained support with voters in swing states.

""I think the Democrats would rather not get a fair shake, if you say, 'We're not going to build a wall' or 'We're not gonna start a war on Muslims or let's start a war over women's health clinics,' or, 'We're not gonna win elections over the Affordable Care Act.' They'll be worried ? 'Oh I'm not voting for the Republicans.' I think the Democratic Party is ready to attack.""

It's worth remembering that Democrats have been able to roll back the GOP agenda over the past three years, which have been largely dominated by Democrats.

While many Democrats have pushed to push in the direction of a liberal agenda in the White House and Congress, it's becoming increasingly apparent that Democrats in most districts have not shown support.

A recent poll by the Democrat Congressional Leadership Fund found that 54-35 percent of voters approved of Trump's job performance.

""Republicans will not be concerned about Hillary Clinton's inability to govern the country, because she's a Democrat: The more voters believe Clinton is an incompetent president, the more Republicans will have a chance of fighting the president, because the more voters trust Hillary Clinton is a failure of American values,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the Senate's leading anti-Muslim advocate.

The Democrat Party has made it harder to reach out to the base of their base ? particularly minorities, who tend to be strongly Democratic ? through support for a president that has taken a ""very, very hostile"" stance against foreign nations.

Democrats have also been at the center of the partisan controversy over the deadly sniper killings at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, that left more than 500 people dead.

Democrats have attempted to link the murder of five police officers to violence at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, and have used the election as a way to attack President Barack Obama and his family and critics.

""It is critical that we address the threats created by these kinds of policies ? like these murders ? that make us less safe, less safe. We need a more informed decision about how we can tackle our social and security concerns,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., referring to the shooting to ensure that the GOP candidate has the votes.

Republican Party officials are still talking about taking their anti-abortion messaging seriously, but have also not softened their anti-gun rhetoric toward women themselves.

""There is always going to be some kind of compromise on this as a political issue, but the president's policies make it so, 'No, I'll do that' ? it looks like that's what we're dealing with,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., referring to the president's new policies on guns.

""But that's not a good thing for our country, especially if you say the president's policies make it so ... a whole lot more dangerous than the president's policies.""

Republican Party officials have argued that the Trump transition operation has not given the administration enough time to establish internal guidelines for the administration and the way in which the administration approaches these issues.

""The president's policies are very focused when the White House gets in, when the administration makes a determination, and the way we've been trying to push through those policies has taken some time to arrive,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).

A number of prominent Democrats have also had some harsh words at the White House:

""The president wants to say just a little bit, because a lot of what goes on inside the White House is very, very clear and very clear that he wants to do what's really needed.""

Democrats are looking back at the past two years at trying to figure out how to improve the tone of the political system, and this time Republicans are attempting to make their way through an aggressive agenda over any kind of legislation.

It will be important to keep an eye on the coming midterm elections and what they will try to accomplish next.

""I have no doubt that the Republicans have a lot of work ahead of them, but I don't expect them to be as ready,"" Sen",machine
"Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick and New York Democratic Rep. Anthony Brindisi weigh in.Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Penn., and Rep. Anthony Brindisi, D-N.Y., joined ""Your World"" Thursday to discuss bipartisan legislation that pushed to dissuade cities and state against ""defunding"" law enforcement.""What the bill says is that if a city moves to defund the police department, they want to abolish the police department or significantly cut funding to a police department...that would put them at risk of losing certain federal grants,"" Brindisi told guest host Charles Payne.""And I think we have to step back and acknowledge that our law enforcement does, by and large, very good work. Most officers serve with dignity and respect. And these are very difficult times that our country is going through right now. We should be having conversations about how we reform policing and improve relations.""TRUMP TO 'SURGE' FEDERAL AGENTS TO CHICAGO, OTHER CITIES, AMID SPIKE IN VIOLENT CRIME""However, I don't think we should be doing that at the expense of cutting back on things like community engagement programs or body cameras, which hold bad actors accountable, or on training, which police need to be able to protect and serve,"" the Democrat form New York added.Fitzpatrick expressed the importance of a bipartisan effort, adding that police officers are ""under assault"" and that reforms are needed but in a ""responsible way.""I'm a career FBI agent. I spent my entire adult life in law enforcement. And my goal was to build bipartisan coalition here in Washington, D.C., to make sure that we have a voice defending our police officers,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""They are under assault right now and they need our support. Do we need to make reforms? Of course we do. And our coalition believes that that should happen and we will do that in a responsible manner.""""We need some voices of reason and they need to start speaking up,"" Fitzpatrick added.Brindisi expressed his worry that police departments would lose funding for the very programs that will help community relations.""When you start cutting back, the first thing the departments will start cutting are things like community policing, community engagement programs, training, things like that, gear that is necessary for officer safety,"" Brindisi said.

"Aahtrell Johnson remembered the police car rolling up, just before he was about to take his shot at the basket under the pine trees. It was 2016, and his neighbor had called 911, complaining that he was getting loud in the street. A white officer named Bobby White had been sent to respond.As Mr. White, a Florida native with a trimmed goatee, approached Mr. Johnson, who is Black, the officer could see the 17-year-old was only playing basketball with his friend. Rather than issue a ticket, Mr. Johnson recalled, the officer asked if he could join the game. He shot some hoops with the teenagers, and others came out of their homes.No one noticed that Mr. White?s dashboard camera was running the whole time.The video ? posted online by the Police Department afterward and watched by millions of viewers ? was a moment of hope in an age where recordings of police brutality were the ones going viral. Mr. White became a celebrity in Gainesville, Fla., and was nicknamed ?Basketball Cop.? Sports stars came to play pickup games with the Gainesville teens. Mr. White founded a nonprofit to ease relations between the police and Black youths and was invited on NBC?s ?Nightly News? and ESPN to promote it.?He didn?t look at us like we were criminals,? Mr. Johnson, now 22, said.But Chanae Jackson, a real estate agent who was born in Gainesville, had a different understanding of policing in the city. Her son had a troubling encounter with law enforcement in 2018, and she became a vocal critic of the department. This May, someone sent her another video of Mr. White: A cellphone recording of him slamming a Black teenager into the hood of his patrol car.After the killing of George Floyd, Ms. Jackson decided she would release the video.And with just a click on Facebook, she set off an uproar that stripped away not only Mr. White?s image as the face of what good neighborhood policing should be but also the assumption ? embraced by liberal-minded reformers in Gainesville and across the country ? that fixing racial bias could be as simple as retraining officers and focusing on ?community policing.??The culture of police departments creates an environment where there are no real consequences for these officers,? Ms. Jackson wrote in her post under the clip of Mr. White?s encounter with the teenager, who was pulled over for running a stop sign on his bicycle.Gainesville, a largely white and liberal college town, likes to think of itself as different from its neighbors in the Deep South, both in its politics and its policing.This summer, it responded to calls for defunding the police with a proposal to eliminate city money for stationing police officers in schools. Shortly afterward, officials removed a Confederate general?s name from an elementary school and vowed to rename it. In 2015, the police chief had invited the Justice Department to retrain its entire force.Yet Black residents like Ms. Jackson argued that law enforcement in Gainesville remained plagued by the racist legacies of a time when its police officers enforced Jim Crow laws.?Peel back the layers, and Gainesville is not progressive at all,? she said.Since the killing of Mr. Floyd on May 25, a similar scrutiny of the police has been underway nationwide. And what?s at play is the fundamental question of how the police are perceived. Or, as the two videos of Mr. White illustrate: Do you think a cop is more likely to play ball, or throw you on the hood of a car?In Gainesville, Mr. White remains in the police department. He declined interview requests for this article and provided a copy of a 2015 internal investigation which cleared him of wrongdoing.Mr. Johnson, the teenager Mr. White approached in the basketball video, fondly recalled the games he played with the officer and the group of teens Mr. White called ?the crew.? Mr. Johnson remembered going with Mr. White to see the Orlando Magic for the first time and how Mr. White stayed in touch and helped him move out of his family home when he got older.But Mr. Johnson hadn?t seen the other video, the one of the arrest, and asked to watch it on his phone.When a Times reporter called him back later that day, his voice had changed. He said his perceptions were different now.?I wouldn?t be surprised if there?s a video of every policeman in the world like that,? Mr. Johnson said. ?It?s what they?re taught.?At age 17, Mr. Johnson said he couldn?t help but notice his interactions with the Gainesville Police Department kept becoming more frequent. They were often harassing, he said, and the stops always came after he had finished playing basketball and his friends walked one another home.This time the police car pulled up before the teenager had even finished his game. But when Mr. White stepped out in 2016, he had a smile on his face.?Can you believe that someone called complaining that kids are playing basketball in the street?? Mr. White asks in the video recorded on his dashboard camera. ?But I ain?t got no problems with it.?The boy tosses the officer the ball and the two start to play.Mr. White came to the Police Department in 2008, a transplant from South Florida. Though white, he has said that he came to identify with some of the struggles of many Black youth in the city. He grew up with a single mother who died of drug addiction at a young age. There was never a male role model in his household.But there was a big difference when it came to the police. In a podcast interview last year, Mr. White said that as a child he remembered thinking the police ?were like superheroes.? He didn?t get that reception from children when he arrived in Gainesville.?I noticed right away that the kids were scared of us,? he said.That was because relations between law enforcement and African-Americans in Gainesville had long been uneasy, and would soon be more strained. Even before the killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner made national news, the city was dealing with a string of brutal incidents involving the police and sheriff?s officers in the city.In 2009, two unarmed Black men were shot by officers during separate altercations; one died, and the other, who was mentally ill, survived only after his colon was removed. The next year, an officer unleashed an attack dog that mauled Bryce Bates, a 10-year-old boy, in responding to what turned out to be a false report of a burglary. In 2012, a 29-year-old Black man named Nehemiah Dillard died of a heart attack after being hit twice with Tasers during an arrest.?The chief saw a trend he didn?t like,? said Jorge Campos, the chief inspector of the Police Department. The police chief ordered the department to be retrained ? from a traditional policing model that focused mainly on crime fighting, to one in which Mr. Campos said policing would be done ?in conjunction with the community,? which had long been the department?s goal.The city requested help from Justice Department officials, who assigned teams to meet officers in separate sessions on racial profiling, the use of force and when to report biased tactics.Lorie Fridell, a criminologist who set up the training, said the venue allowed officers to admit prejudice such as ?when I see young Black males, my response is ?danger and crime,?? and to try to overcome their unconscious biases before returning to work.But the turnaround effort needed a face. Mr. White?s basketball video, which went viral months after the training, made him the obvious choice. The officer was becoming popular on Facebook, where he often posted pictures of himself surrounded by smiling Black children who posed with him on his beat.Mr. White did a circuit of cable-news interviews, saying the police had been misunderstood in videos of police brutality that only showed law enforcement at its worst. Gainesville offered a counterexample, he insisted.When a construction company asked to help, Mr. White had a cement court built behind the home of one of the teenagers. He founded a nonprofit, Basketball Cop Foundation, to distribute basketballs to police departments around the country with the motto ?hoops, not crime.??It?s no secret that there is a damaged relationship between our country?s law enforcement and the youth in the communities we serve,? he wrote in the foundation?s mission statement. ?I also believe that kids do not prefer to feel this way, but society, with the help of social media and the news has influenced them.?Mr. Johnson described Mr. White as a gentle, almost fatherly presence. The officer helped the teenager find a job after high school. Mr. White came with other officers, dressed in Santa Claus hats, to distribute gifts in the neighborhood at Christmas and hosted birthday parties for children whose parents couldn?t afford them.There was even a surprise visit from Shaquille O?Neal, whom Mr. White brought in 2016 to the same street where the video was filmed.Mr. O?Neal ordered up a shooting contest for the teenagers, offering $100 for each successful free throw. The visit was featured on ?Good Morning America.?But Mr. Johnson said things changed when Mr. White and the television cameras were gone. He was still being followed by the police, who would ask to search his shoes for marijuana and sometimes ask if he had been selling drugs.?I was in high school, my friends were in the eighth or ninth grade,? he said.It turned out even Mr. O?Neal had run into problems the day he visited Gainesville. The N.B.A. star was pulled over by state troopers and questioned before he arrived to meet the teens, Mr. White later said.Chanae Jackson had just received the call she said she had feared since moving back to Gainesville, where she grew up. Her 18-year-old son, Keyon Young, was on the other line, and officers from the sheriff?s department had pulled his car over for allegedly speeding and told him to get out.It was 2018, and Ms. Jackson was getting her start as a real estate agent in the city after raising her son in Atlanta. She returned home in 2016 to take care of her father, who was ill. But Gainesville wasn?t Atlanta, she told her son, especially when it came to the police. During her pregnancy, officers there once slammed her on the hood of a car during a traffic stop, she said.She told her son to keep his hands visible and stay in the car. She would call 911, hoping the dispatcher there would ask the officers not to escalate the situation.Dash cam footage released by the sheriff?s department showed what happened next. Two white officers rush toward Mr. Young?s Volvo. One pulls open the door and shouts, ?Exit the vehicle or you?re going to jail.? Both officers then lunge into the car. There?s a brief struggle and one officer steps back to point his weapon at Mr. Young?s head.?I thought they were going to kill him,? Ms. Jackson said.Ms. Jackson jumped into her car and sped down the streets near her home, searching for the traffic stop. She found her son in handcuffs when she arrived.She pulled out her phone and began to broadcast her son?s arrest on Facebook to hundreds of friends and family.?Y?all know me, y?all know I don?t ever go live ? anything I have to say, I say within the confines of my own home,? she said, her anger rising. But this time was different, she said. ?They?ve messed with the wrong child.?As her son was arrested, Ms. Jackson referred to studies on policing by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Poverty Law Center. She cited arrest statistics of Black people in Gainesville. Ms. Jackson kept the camera rolling, through a first video, a second and a third hours later as her son drove her home after his release.?I?ve told Keyon, as a Black man in America you have two strikes against you, no matter how well you speak, no matter how well you do,? she said in the video.A judge later cleared Mr. Young of the speeding charge. But the experience caught the attention of the small but growing activist community in the city. Just as the video of the policeman playing basketball made Mr. White the spokesman of the law enforcement reform effort, the video of the angered mother made Ms. Jackson a star critic of the police in Gainesville.It had been two years since the Police Department had undergone retraining. But a study by the University of Florida found racial disparities persisted. While African-Americans accounted for only a fifth of the population, they were four times as likely to be arrested in Gainesville than whites. Black teens were seven times as likely to be arrested than white teens.Less than a year after the Department of Justice training, officers shot and killed Robert Dentmond, a 16-year-old Black high school student who had called 911 saying he was armed and suicidal. Officers fired 35 times after he refused to put down what was found later to be a plastic weapon. A grand jury found the killing justified.Ms. Jackson argued that the reforms were only a facade and that law enforcement needed to be taken on more directly.When she saw Black men pulled over as she drove through Gainesville, Ms. Jackson took to stopping and questioning the officers in live Facebook videos. She broadcast to her followers from outside the Alachua County jail and referred to Sadie Darnell, the sheriff, as #ShadySadie in her posts. She was more confrontational than other activists, but said she didn?t mind being a lightning rod.?I take full ownership of being an angry Black woman,? she said. ?Change doesn?t happen in times of comfort.?Ms. Jackson had always been skeptical of Mr. White?s fame and the media attention that his Basketball Cop Foundation received.In mid-May, a group of officers in the Police Department who shared her concerns about racism on the force got in touch with her. They sent her a 2014 video in which Mr. White could be seen violently throwing a young Black man onto the hood of his vehicle after he rode a bicycle through a stop sign.?Black children, in their minds, are compliant,? she said, describing the attitude of the Police Department. That was why Mr. White was popular with the children he knew. ?But Black teenagers are seen as grown people ? the police see them as Black men, and the world is supposed to be scared of them.?On May 25, George Floyd was killed by police officers in Minneapolis. The wave of protests against police brutality reached Gainesville days later. Before a rally, the police chief, Tony Jones, condemned the Minnesota officers. He said Gainesville wasn?t Minneapolis. Its officers had a different philosophy. They had simply been taught differently, retrained in community policing.He echoed so many political leaders who have argued this year that more training, getting to know residents and working with them to solve neighborhood problems, and hiring officers who look like the people they serve is the best way to end police brutality.?What I saw in that video erodes the trust of police,? the chief said.Ms. Jackson thought of the video of Mr. White sitting on her hard drive.Mr. White had also become vocal on social media about the killing of Mr. Floyd. In his view, it left a black eye on officers everywhere, and was pushing the country back toward the police brutality narrative that he?d spent years countering.?I?m a cop. Emotions?.? he wrote on Facebook on May 26 under a video still of the arrest. ?I am DISGUSTED by the actions of this officer. I am ANGRY at the officers on the scene who didn?t stop him.?Mr. White?s Facebook page for his Basketball Cop Foundation had given the officer a platform well beyond Gainesville. About 140,000 people nationwide followed his posts on the good deeds of the police, like a local television segment Mr. White posted of one officer who gave a laptop to someone after hers was stolen.But Mr. Floyd?s death marked a turning point. Some of Mr. White?s followers asked him whether the police were deliberately targeting Black people. Mr. White argued that there was no larger problem, saying his own white family was treated the same as Black families by the police.?I?m a cop and my teenaged son is white. I still had ?the talk? with him, too,? he wrote, referring to how to behave during a police stop. ?It?s because I know it?s your actions that will get you shot, not your race.?Mr. White?s followers began to push him on the unrest and looting in Minneapolis, which some said was justified, one quoting a speech by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Mr. White argued that businesses shouldn?t be harmed.As the criticism mounted, Mr. White dug in. He posted an article from the far-right website Breitbart News decrying ?those smearing every police officer,? and another item about recent crime in Chicago, saying there was too little focus on ?Black-on-Black? crime.?What about the thousands of black babies aborted each year?? asked one commenter in the thread. ?Why is it different when a white person is killed similarly by the police??Mr. White clicked ?like.?As the disputes between Mr. White and his followers reached a peak, Ms. Jackson returned to the video that was sent to her.She had been trying to gather more information before releasing it. Shot on a cellphone, the video showed an encounter from 2014. Semajiah Ferguson, then 16 years old, stands next to Mr. White, looking at the ground as the lights flash on the patrol car at nighttime.?He bothering us Black folks for no reason,? says Mr. Ferguson?s cousin, who was recording the video. ?Can you tell us what we did, sir??In an interview, Mr. Ferguson recalled he had been riding his bicycle home to his parents? house after picking up a two-liter bottle of Tropical Punch when he was stopped.Mr. White later told his superiors the teenager had committed two minor traffic violations ? running a stop sign and having improper lighting for the bike ? but on the video, the officer mentions neither. Instead, he tells the teenager to sit on the ground. Mr. Ferguson says he doesn?t want to.Mr. White suddenly grabs the young man, and pins his knees against the hood. The boy goes limp. The officer then throws Mr. Ferguson?s upper body against the hood of the vehicle twice, and a loud thud can be heard.?Down! Down! Lay down on the car!? Mr. White shouts.Watching it again, Ms. Jackson decided on June 14 that other people should see this video of Mr. White, too.As the video circulated on Facebook, she began to see in the comments that this kind of behavior from the police in Gainesville was a surprise to some residents. ?Before, some people said we didn?t even need protests in Gainesville because there was no police brutality,? she said.The video generated outrage among the city?s leaders. Gail Johnson, a city commissioner, said it showed the kind of overzealous policing over minor infractions that her Black constituents had long complained was commonplace. ?It is grounded in racism,? she said. ?I don?t even know how to approach it.?Residents and activists, brought to the streets after the Minneapolis killing, now began to rally against Mr. White in their demonstrations as marches continued around Gainesville. If the police had the video of the arrest, many asked, how was it that the officer had been allowed to work with young children for so many years?The department released a lengthy statement saying that it had looked into the arrest years before and it didn?t violate any departmental policy. It also said prosecutors hadn?t found any evidence of wrongdoing by the officer even though authorities had found no crime with which to charge the teenager he had thrown.?The search was captured on video and appeared proper,? said a police report on the incident.Soon after the department?s statement, which once more praised its community policing model, Ms. Jackson found herself under attack by law enforcement officers for releasing the video.Becki Holcomb, a white officer who dated Mr. White and worked on the force when it underwent retraining, went after Ms. Jackson on the official Facebook page of the Gainesville Police Department.?Chanae Jackson, you are a horrible person and you should be ashamed of yourself,? the officer wrote under the department?s statement on Mr. Ferguson?s arrest. ?You are a liar, a race baiter and one of the most uneducated, hateful women I?ve ever had to deal with.?Not long after, Ashley Mauger, a 911 dispatcher in the sheriff?s office, threatened to run background checks on those who were criticizing Mr. White on Facebook. She then turned her attention to Ms. Jackson, calling her a ?hothead? and criticizing her grammar.?I can?t fathom the response you will get the next time you dial 911 and possibly get me on the phone with a loved one or yourself in a life-or-death emergency,? she wrote, adding, ?you should all be ashamed of yourselves.?Ms. Mauger was briefly suspended for her comments; Ms. Holcomb is under investigation, the police said.Ms. Jackson said that while the attacks by the officers angered her, she was not surprised.If anything, Ms. Jackson said she felt some vindication. After years of hearing white neighbors praise Gainesville?s policing, the video and the reactions showed a reality that contradicted that of the ?Basketball Cop.??I said, ?There they go, proving my point again,?? she said of the fallout.Ms. Jackson continues her efforts to hold the police accountable in her online videos. Driving for errands in the nearby city of Ocala in early July, she pulled over when she saw more than a dozen police cars surrounding a group of teenagers of color, and started filming.When the traffic stop finished, she yelled out to the young men to pull over a second time ? she wanted to instruct them on how to file a complaint if they felt the stop was unwarranted.?I?m gonna record for y?all to see every time this happens, every time,? she says to her online audience in the video.Stella Cooper contributed reporting.",human
"Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano weighs in.Civil rights activists DeRay Mckesson on Wednesday spoke about the growing calls to defund police, explaining that it ?really means ?move the money to follow responsibilities.?? Mckesson made the comments during an appearance on Washington Post Live, alongside former police chief Charles Ramsey. ?I think there are twoÿbig buckets. One is, how do you reduce the power of the police immediately? And, how do we shrink the role of the police?? Mckesson said. ?The ?defund? language is hard for some people but it really is this idea of move the money to follow the responsibilities.? He then argued that police officers have been given too many responsibilities that, in many cases, would be better served by experts. ?Who should be dealing with the mental health crisis? Probably an expert, probably not a police officer. Who should respond to somebody with suicidal ideation? Probably a mental health expert. Probably not an officer. Who should respond to homelessness? Probably a social worker,? Mckesson said. ?We don?t need to dump money into the police. Public safety is a function of all the other things.?Ramsey, who was also on Washington Post Live?s Wednesday segment, said he agreed in principle with Mckesson but thought ?defund the police"" was a poor choice of words.?Personally, I don?t have a problem with reallocating funds to community-based social services,?

"Trump Continues Criticism of Movement to Defund the Police

Over the past three years, the NYPD has become increasingly aggressive in using controversial tactics to intimidate and, most recently, intimidate and intimidate independent journalists, journalists who report a ""terrorist,"" people who report a crime or have their credentials verified by the NYPD as terrorist or a terrorist.

This past week, The New York Times published an article that described the NYPD's aggressive tactics as well as its efforts to silence dissenting voices, including both ""persons"" and ""progressive"" reporters.

One such ""persons"" reporter posted a text in response to a New York Times op-ed in which she reported, ""I love your country, but is your opinion at a gunning point or is your voice not respected?""

The Times issued an editorial Monday, claiming that her comments were a ""tragedy"" because she had been ""calling for a change,"" according to The New York Times, a magazine published for The Nation, which tracks news coverage of the nation's most important topics.

""I am a victim of domestic violence, I'm a victim of domestic violence ... I have a husband and a daughter. They do not believe in a war. They believe in war,"" she wrote, ""I'm a good American. I've never been a prisoner of war. I can go to my house, and I will be a better man.""<|endoftext|>A number of states are considering asking for a ban on marijuana sales, with Arizona and Washington acting in a different measure. (Photo: Adam Gershon / Special to the Arizona Sun)

The Arizona Republic is not expected to have a specific cannabis sales ban in place by the end of the year, according to Arizona marijuana official Jeff Clemmons.

An official with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Marijuana Control and Protection Act says a ban would have to be in place by then, if the state were to collect all the tax benefits the pot clubs could collect. The official spoke with the Arizona Republic about the possibility.

""Although it's a controlled substance, it's a product like cocaine, but in order to produce it for the purposes that individuals would have to be able to transport the substance to their jobs,"" the director said.

Many of the Arizona's businesses also are located in rural areas, including Arizona's Mesa fir, Mesa Delta and El Verde.

The issue is legal under Arizona's new legislation, SB 954, which was introduced by Gov Jan Brewer during her 2017 State of the Industry Summit. Brewer's office said in a press release that the bill is unrelated to Arizona and was approved by the Arizona state Legislature in December 2017. The bill will be presented to the General Assembly in the Fall of 2018 for approval. Brewer has said she opposes the state's medical marijuana program because it causes dependence on the drugs.



A number of stores in the state are already offering deals on cannabis-based products, but just this week, Starbucks did it with cannabis-based coffee.

In November Arizona's legislature approved the medical marijuana retail program for low-income folks. That program is expected to grow to about 1,600 licensed users by 2020.

""The reality is that they cannot operate at scale, and for this particular marijuana business model to appear to be in place is a big problem,"" Clemmons said.

Arizona's laws vary widely, with the vast majority of the law being passed by the General Assembly after 2014, according to data compiled by the Department of Health and Human Services.

In the state's previous law, when the bill was introduced in 2014, 12.5 percent of the licenses were for cannabis-based products.

The proposed law is currently up for consideration in the Arizona Senate for its approval.

The ban follows an announcement in a statement Tuesday morning that Israel had announced a moratorium on the construction of new settlements in the West Bank and Benjamin Netanyahu condemned attacks on Palestinians living in the occupied territories.

"Mass protests in response to the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade have raised comparisons to the 1992 Los Angeles Rebellion.On April 29, 1992, a jury acquitted four Los Angeles Police Department officers of assault against Rodney King, a black man whose 1991 brutalization by the police ? which lasted for at least fifteen minutes ? had been recorded from an observer?s apartment balcony.ÿThe video circulated nationwide. Protests began a few hours after the verdict was announced, with significant momentum building in South Central Los Angeles and Koreatown. Along with the acquittals, a key spark of the rebellion, as Brenda Stevenson documents, was the sentencing by a white judge in the case of Korean storeowner Soon Ja Du. A few weeks before Rodney King?s assault, Du shot and killed Latasha Harlins, a fifteen-year-old black girl, during a dispute over a bottle of orange juice. Convicted of voluntary manslaughter in October 1991, Du was sentenced by Joyce Karlin to probation, community service, and a fine.ÿBy the time the LA Rebellion ended in early May, over five thousand people had been arrested, many for violating curfews. Numerous immigrants from Mexico and Latin America were deported. Over a thousand buildings, mostly commercial property, would be damaged, looted, or destroyed. Los Angeles in 1992 was the last time the Insurrection Act, which President Trump threatened to use against today?s protestors, was deployed. William Barr, like now, was attorney general.ÿHistory, it seems, is repeating itself all over again. But if we look at the political demands expressed in response to state repression being unleashed on protesters, we?ve come a long way. Today, more of us are rejecting the types of reforms that were promised in response to the LA Rebellion.ÿThe 1992 uprising stemmed from not only police brutality and racism but also the poverty and economic conditions people were forced to survive. The solution proposed by many political leaders and pundits at the time was more corporate investment, lending, and minority business development. Capital investment and public-private partnerships would address what they saw as the failures of the social welfare state. This approach saw neighborhoods as economically neglected rather than targets of economic and racial violence.The economically neglected explanation worked in tandem with defenses of Korean immigrant storeowners, who incurred almost half of the city?s billion dollars in property loss. Long-standing critiques of the concentration of Korean-owned stores in black neighborhoods were often answered with the claim that they filled the void created by corporations who refused to do business there, which depicted Korean storeowners as haplessly in the rebellion?s path but not implicated in neighborhood conditions. Nonwhite scholars pushed ?going beyond black and white? to analyze what?s been described as a multiracial riot and to decry what they saw as misguided targeting of Asians.ÿCalls for racial reconciliation, whether expressed by academics, activists, and civic leaders, were buttressed by claims that the rebellion was partly fueled by mutual misunderstanding between racial groups. President Bill Clinton would later champion a similar explanation of racial conflict at the federal level. In 1997 he appointed a national commission on race, which, in the shadow of his crime bill and welfare reform, held race dialogues, dubbed ?One America Conversations,? in thirty-nine states.?Race relations? and capital investment, rather than using the power of the state to redistribute wealth and decrease the power of police, were the solutions of the day.Today, more people are letting us know that empty dialogues and corporate solidarity statements are not enough. Whether in the streets, on social media, or in communications with bosses, colleagues, and organizations, more people are telling those in power that the time for talk is over if it?s not accompanied by serious structural changes.ÿMost importantly, we?re seeing an unequivocal demand that was not as widespread in the wake of 1992: Defund the police. While stopping police brutality and reforming the criminal justice system were major goals of residents and community activists in 1992 Los Angeles, the demand for defunding the police brings us closer to creating lasting alternatives to policing, punishment, and imprisonment.ÿOf course, ?defunding the police? is not inherently abolitionist. Indeed, without abolition as both process and goal, defunding the police in practice could be coupled with increased vigilantism, particularly from white people, as seen with contemporary lynchings, such as the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, or in armed responses to today?s protests. And the private sector, including the tech industry with its supposed innovations, all too willingly develops and maintains surveillance upholding a carceral state, as well as employs its own private security forces.ÿThus we need to remain vigilant of not being politically diverted by what Toni Cade Bambara describes as ?the sharks, the next wave of repression, or the next smear campaign? trying to move us towards policing by other means. What defunding the police does, in this moment, is help us avoid the pitfalls of those reforms that, as Mariame Kaba warns, may ultimately strengthen the police financially and institutionally.ÿThe demand to defund the police also has what Ruth Wilson Gilmore describes as stretch, helping us ?to reach further than the immediate object without bypassing its particularity.? It can help us interrogate reforms that promote capital and weaken the social welfare state, such as those proposed in response to the 1992 LA Rebellion. We can instead ask how budgets are created and who and what we prioritize in terms of their use. And it can encourage us to reimagine work beyond punishment industries and occupying occupations.ÿIn our current economy, millions of people labor as police officers or for the Department of Defense, which is currently the largest employer in the United States. Finally, defunding the police can open up more space to imagine a less punitive social welfare state ? as mass incarceration, as noted by Elizabeth Hinton, was partly fueled by crime control measures enacted to regulate social welfare programs ? and to normalize a more humane social welfare state where everyone?s basic needs are met.ÿWhile it?s far too soon to declare victory, let?s take stock of how far political demands have come since the 1992 LA Rebellion. Calls to defund the police, and more importantly, the momentum the demand is gaining, is progress from below. It is a major political advancement from the post-1992 push for capital investment, public-private partnerships, or facile ?race relations? dialogues, all gestures that rehabilitate capitalism ? which always engenders policing ? but don?t ultimately confront power or the structure of our economy.ÿLet?s celebrate this victory and keep going.",human
"GOP group runs ad attacking Dems over 'defund the police' movement The group is ""not going to stand for a Democrat. It's going to stand for political police"". The group said in an online message on Reddit that the march had a ""small number of people"" to target because they are not members of the Democratic National Committee, although they can say that they are not involved with the DNC.

One person described themselves as wearing the green scarf of the New York Police Department. The crowd was divided over the event as two Democrats approached members of the crowd, all wearing a blue cap.

This will serve as a summary of my life as a former New York City cop. As the author of The Violent Confessions, it has been argued that since I was a young man who had committed crimes, it was a difficult and confusing place for me to be a cop.

However, the author also makes note that I had made a lot of progress in my career as a police officer, especially in the past few years. As I was still living comfortably, I was able to go to my friend's house in New York City once a year, and it became clear to me that I was really close to the process of getting a job in the NYPD, and I felt better about it than I ever would have felt.

I had, at about the same points where I had tried to deal with the crime problem of street crime in New York City in the past and it was my initial suggestion to start a job as a police officer in the NYPD.

I immediately went to work on finding an attorney who would have been willing to help me with my decision. I had not gotten a job, in the past I had tried to get a teaching job and found a job in a local school. I had only taken a couple of hours in the week before I would have been in the city so I had the option to work from home, which I did before the job ended (though it may have been a bit late for this story).

My lawyer had also suggested for me that I get a job in the NYPD but I was not satisfied. This was very unexpected from a person with a little bit of a grey area, and I was quite disappointed by its simplicity. On the other hand, my lawyer told me about getting a job in the NYPD (which I had already given up) and that I should do my best. We started writing stories that would have been really fun, had I thought I was going to be the first person to write a piece about the issue of street crime, or even become involved in it, but the job seemed too hard.

It was a pretty simple decision that I made just for fun (which did involve me being part of a group like the NYPD). It was basically a personal decision to end an experience I could have, but I thought I'd take the chance of talking to a family about it, and make the best of it. My attorney was very supportive, and he did this for the better part of three days in a row, although this is still an exceptionally difficult decision, although I have a small amount of confidence in the attorney's experience and skills. I was very grateful for everything he had done, especially if I could do the same thing in his position.

While I thought I was going to work on building out a professional organization that would help him as an investigative judge and law professor, my lawyer took exception to them. I felt I had some sort of authority over the attorney, but unfortunately this was not enough. Once I was on the ground, the detective called me, and I was informed that he would need to look into this with a view to finding a lawyer willing to go under the radar, then his work would get really complicated and he was forced to look to me. When the detective came back, he was very disappointed to see that I was getting into a position that I didn't have a prior view on. He told me that the prosecutor would have to look and see if I would be able to prove the matter. His reaction was that although he was obviously in a position to make a decision on why I was trying to do things, I had found a pretty strong case that was not going to be as straightforward as I thought it could be. I had been told that I didn't know what the lawyer asked me to do, that I was being investigated for crimes I had committed without being served, and that this was a terrible decision. It was a difficult time for me, but I had already done a lot more to help those families that had lost loved ones to violence during the years of domestic violence. I also learned that I wasn't getting any other help, so I was being able to prove that I was a real",machine
"In the weeks since the killing of George Floyd by police officer Derek Chauvin in Minneapolis, Black Lives Matter protests have thrust the demand to defund the police into the national conversation.Around the country, police budgets are so bloated as to be grotesque. New York City spends over $11 billion annually on its police force ? more than the entire military budget of Colombia. While New York City?s police department is the most highly funded in the country, other cities also maintain exorbitant police budgets and allocate enormous percentages of their total public resources to do so. Los Angeles?s $1.8 billion police budget, for example, represents 17.5 percent of the city?s total annual spending.As historian Stuart Schrader explains in the following interview, American police have been startlingly successful at claiming larger and larger pieces of the fiscal pie since the 1960s, even as nearly every other public agency has faced austerity.Schrader, whose book Badges Without Borders analyzed the co-development of global counterinsurgency and American policing during the twentieth century, argues that police in the United States have developed into a self-interested social actor since the 1960s, helping eviscerate social spending by aggressively organizing to expand their own budgets. Through this kind of fiscal intimidation, Schrader writes in Public Culture, ?police have come to protect neither party machines nor the legitimacy of the state but, rather, themselves.?For generations, liberal police reformers have responded to calls for increased police accountability by allocating still more money to police budgets, oftentimes earmarked for gadgets like body cameras or feeble gestures like implicit-bias trainings.In another paper ? ?More Than Cosmetic Changes,? published in the Journal of Urban History ? Schrader analyzes the trajectory of police reform in the 1960s and ?70s, showing how some figures, like Menlo Park police chief Victor Cizanckas, attempted to restore police legitimacy through ?demilitarization,? by eliminating the rank hierarchy and introducing ?mod? uniforms that featured civilian-style blazers. But reformers like Cizanckas could never resolve the contradiction at the heart of policing: that police power is premised on the discretionary use of violence, and therefore cannot be effectively restrained by procedural reforms or technical changes.Today, the demand is unequivocal: only aggressive defunding and reallocation of resources away from police can satisfy the movement in the street. Jacobin?s Jonah Walters spoke with Schrader about how the police have come to serve themselves and why protesters? demands will not be easily quieted by compromise.In your paper ?To Protect and Serve Themselves,? you describe how American police came to understand themselves as a collective political actor, capable of acting in their own self-interest. You write, ?The police of today might be best characterized not as partisan or professional, but as profiteering.? What does it mean for police to be self-interested, and how did this self-interest develop?Historians of police in the United States tend to agree that there was a significant shift in police practice between the late nineteenth century and the mid-twentieth century. This is the shift toward professionalization.Professionalization meant removing police from the political control of party machines and local power brokers. It was a slow process, but direct political control over police was mostly ended by the mid-twentieth century, and technical reforms were widely adopted. This shift in organization did not change the function of policing, in terms of securing private property, maintaining racial hierarchy, and weakening and suppressing working-class power, of course. If anything, it made it more effective and legitimate.If the early period, when police served at the pleasure of political machines, was the ?partisan? period, then the mid-twentieth century was the ?professional? period. For the third period, which we?re living in now, I use the term ?profiteering.? When it definitively began is fuzzy, but I would place it around the 1980s.The ?profiteering? period is marked by growing fiscal commitments in government budgets to police, while other agencies are facing austerity. Today, the effort to increase police legitimacy through professionalization is, I think, subsumed under a broader demand for spending commitments at federal, state, and local levels, as well as philanthropic spending on police. Police have become very good at achieving high budgets while hiding the fact that they are basically the only agency that has managed to avoid austerity.I want to point out that ?profiteering? is a bit of a misnomer. It?s not the case that state revenues or state expenditures are actually profits. (Ruth Wilson Gilmore is emphatic on this point.) I?m not saying that police are profiting in the sense that a capitalist firm profits. What I?m saying is that police have developed political efforts to reinforce their budgets, and they have become insatiable in their demand for robust appropriations. Both police unions and consortia of expert reformers, often at odds with each other, have come to support continued strong spending on policing.Police have played a key role in eviscerating state capacity by making sure that their budgets remain high while other budgets get cut. There?s simply nowhere else for people to turn, so they call 911 and the police come, and far too often the result is something catastrophic.Police are able to command an incredible amount of deference from elected officials. You write that police ?wield respect like a pistol in a stickup.? Why is deference to the police such an ingrained political value in this country?Public opinion of police legitimacy is in a mutually supportive relationship with police efforts to command support among the public. This dynamic distorts public perception of what police actually do and what policing actually looks like.Part of this is because politicians have been arguing for more than fifty years that police deserve respect despite the abuses they commit. This is a consistent theme of political discourse, but it has intensified since 9/11. This expectation of unquestioned respect has trapped people like New York City mayor Bill de Blasio, even Barack Obama. Obama, for example, tried very meekly to register some discontent with policing, and he faced the full wrath of police, conservative media, and elected officials. That kind of bullying is real, and I don?t think we can discount it.I think we also need to pay attention to the media sphere. Turn on the TV on any given night, and you can find multiple programs occurring simultaneously that lionize police as heroic protectors of society. One result of this kind of media is that people vastly overestimate how much violent, interpersonal crime there is and their own level of risk to it.There is also a long trend of police gaining support from political officials who are willing to speak on their behalf. New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, who instigated a police riot in 1992 while David Dinkins was still mayor, is a primary symbol of this. I think that in the past four years of the Trump era, this trend has only intensified. Trump is picking up on something that figures like Giuliani (or maybe even somebody like Alabama governor George Wallace or Philadelphia mayor and former cop Frank Rizzo) pioneered earlier on.I will say, though, that one accomplishment of the ongoing rebellions is that folks are learning just how much money police may earn (including through overtime pay) compared to what other civil servants earn. People are sharing charts that display how municipalities allocate resources. And many people are shocked at the disparities between police and parks, libraries, mental health, homeless services, and so on.One thing that sets the ongoing rebellion apart from the 1960s, or even 2014?15, is how widely the demand to defund the police has been taken up. What kind of reformist period might we be headed into?Change is happening, but the contours of the period we?re beginning are still indistinct. The situation is fluid, and mobilizations are ongoing. Think of Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey, who has tried to find a way to respond to the rebellion in his city without completely burning his administrative relationship with the police. It?s proving impossible for him, because he can?t respond to the demands of activists in the streets ? who are asking for the police department to be dismantled and for that money to be redirected ? in such a way that would mollify the police.Protesters have forced a confrontation that, in many ways, cannot be reconciled through compromise. That?s why the city council in Minneapolis is now planning to disband the city police.How this proposal is going to play out is a bit unclear. Many people are holding up the example of Camden, New Jersey. But we need to be very clear that, in Camden, the disbanding of the city police was not accompanied by reinvestment in the socioeconomic empowerment of marginalized residents, and thus fell far, far short of a solution.We can?t separate the call to defund police from the call to redirect that money into other types of state capacities, up to and including jobs programs, and a decarceral Green New Deal. I worry that if we can?t make that positive demand alongside the negative one, what comes next is just more austerity. The powerful might concede to less spending on police, and then send that money right back into the hands of propertied taxpayers rather than into new expenditures on other types of services. Given the budgetary shortfalls that loom due to COVID-19 and the shutdowns, there is a real threat of new types of austerity.Mutual aid programs developed during the pandemic will prove crucial in an ensuing moment of fiscal retrenchment, and I trust the creativity of those engaging in mutual aid to direct it toward creating a world without police.One sticking point for liberal police reformers is the concept of ?discretion.? What is ?discretion,? and why is it important for understanding police power?Policing is irreducibly defined by discretion because police have to act in the moment. Policing at its core is about discretionary improvisation on the street, in response to a whole variety of cues. The contradiction between rote procedure and unpredictable encounter is an ineradicable element of policing. It results in egregious ? and often lethal ? abuses of power.Police departments have a strict military-style hierarchy, with chiefs at the top of the command issuing orders down the hierarchy, often pushed by property owners and other elites who have the ear of city hall. But the officers at the lowest rank have the most discretion, because they have to respond to unpredictable situations. This is the inverse of how militaries operate. It means that police officers overwhelmingly rely on personal intuition, often shaped by bigotry and machismo, in their encounters, and their intuition is protected, to a certain extent, as their professional prerogative. In this sense, policing, as an institution, is unique.Discretion really hinders police reform, because most reforms are top-down attempts to standardize police behavior. The history of police reform since the 1960s has been marked by increasingly top-down demands for standardization. These reforms require a certain type of police response in every situation, like zero-tolerance policing: every infraction an officer witnesses is going to mean a ticket or an arrest.In 2020, coming out of this rebellion, a lot of well-meaning people are going to be asking for the restoration of a certain type of discretion. There will be those who say that we need to ?liberate? police from top-down standards, and give them the freedom to determine whether or not an incident really requires an arrest.This is a pipe dream. Police should no longer be ?first responders.? The history of liberal police reform during the twentieth century suggests that the only way to meaningfully change police behavior is to reduce police capacity.We might be entering a moment similar to the 1960s, when there were different kinds of police reformers within the profession vying for their own reformist projects. What comes next for the movement to defund the police?I think police scientists have been fairly discredited. Since at least the 1960s, we have been listening to them say, ?Yes, there have been some misdeeds in the past, but the future is bright if you listen to us.? Well, when are we finally going to reach this juncture where their reforms finally take effect?Still, I think we?re going to see these police scientists come back and propose more technical reforms, like additional new capital-intensive technologies: more body cameras, more computerized algorithmic tactical deployment plans, and more surveillance. We need to have a fairly uncompromising position on this. It?s important to remember that Minneapolis was actually a showcase of technical and procedural police reform (anti-bias training and so forth) before the murder of George Floyd.Consciousness about policing in the United States is changing radically right now. That shift is reflected in the bill that Democrats in Congress have put forth, which does not add more money to police budgets. They?re calling for oversight without reward.If you look at this historically, this is a surprising development. In the 1960s, the federal government provided money for police ?innovation? with little oversight and few strings attached. In the 1980s and 1990s, the federal government continued to provide huge amounts of money, including direct funds to hire new police officers, without the imposition of oversight.Now we have a bill that includes no new money for hiring police, but provisions for new oversight. This is a really dramatic change. It remains to be seen what will result from this proposed Democratic legislation, which, it must be said, could nevertheless have been far more sweeping.When the next defense spending bill comes up, there must be pressure not only to shrink the Pentagon budget but to eliminate the so-called 1033 program that facilitates transfers of military surplus gear to police.At the same time, numerous state and city legislators are rapidly introducing and passing new measures to regulate policing and increase transparency, many of which would have been unthinkable a month or two ago. Some concern the use of plastic/rubber bullets and tear gas, which absolutely should be radically restricted. Others ban ?no-knock warrants,? which enabled the police killing of Breonna Taylor.Still, individually, no single piece of legislation is enough, and many legislators remain too convinced of the benefits of procedural reform. But add up all of these individual ripples, and we are witnessing a tidal wave.Popular sentiment is now oriented around a slogan of defunding the police, which is somewhat unprecedented. Credit must go to Angela Davis, Ruth Wilson Gilmore, and Mariame Kaba, who have been making these arguments consistently for decades. If this moment passes with no dramatic change, I believe we?re going to see another rebellion.There?s no way to understand the rebellion of 2020 without understanding the five years since the last rebellions of 2014 and 2015 as evidence of reformists? failures. People are fed up with incremental reformism. That?s worth taking seriously, even (or maybe especially) if you are a liberal reformer. The anger is real, and it is undeniable.",human
"Bernie Sanders Should Embrace the Demand to Defund the Police State

There is a strong case to be made that the police state should be put into place on a mass scale?to end the ethnic profiling that allows many members of the black community to be given no choice in the matter. In the 1980s, while attempting to take back the Latino voting base in Massachusetts, President Carter signed S. 3088, a campaign finance reform bill that effectively dismantled key voting restrictions in a shameful way.

But our role is not just to uphold the idea, but to understand what truly matters. Perhaps the most fundamental of our job is to maintain this democracy and the tools that keep it that way. We do this by adopting the regulatory culture for the agencies and their private citizens and ignoring their privacy rights.

We, like the NAACP, continue to fight for civil rights. This long overdue movement to rebrand the police state comes with the daunting task of building trust between law enforcement agencies and those who have to come under constant scrutiny in the name of public safety. The fact is, a vast majority of officers across the U.S. are gone. By 2017, only five cities or jurisdictions have abolished the use of force, either by officers or magistrates in order to protect their citizens. Many officers no longer fear death by an officer who merely demands to be taken to task.

The problem with police's repeated use of force is that the next police officer to be fired from his job will be a white man, a life threatening individual who, while being sure he is doing his job properly, may be reluctant to comply with protocol.

Shame is a long time coming. One of the aspects of police misconduct that is the tiniest visible effect of racial profiling is that there's only so much accountability it can get in the first place. With that in mind, we must not fear for our safety at all if we use force against our fellow citizens.

"Minnesota Lawmakers Vowed Police Reform. They Couldn?t Agree on Any. The law states ""No evidence, possession of a firearm will affect interstate commerce. No data linking gun ownership, hunting or sports shooting, injury or killing of a person lawfully to the public.""

""Gun ownership may have one of the most significant effects as well, although firearms can also be used in crimes. The law states that if an individual has a loaded gun in the home they will be guilty of violating gun law. The law prohibits possession of firearms in any condition. This includes the right, storage, transport and use of loaded firearm. No record of firearms being held within one-fifth of a house is necessary to complete individual prosecutions. The law states that individuals are immune from a court order to maintain custody and possession of a firearm. There is no reason at all for individuals to use firearms in any manner. They are free to do so. All individuals shall carry firearms and have such weapons, regardless of where they are registered in the state, that they receive a warrant to use them. All persons under the jurisdiction of the country who commit criminal conduct will be subjected to court proceedings on a case-by-case basis, and if a) they do not believe in a legal case, in which case the court has jurisdiction to issue the necessary warrant, and that the law violates the law, the court may therefore subject the individual to prosecution and execution.

""Gun rights will likely have a great influence on the outcome of the next General Assembly vote. A veto in the House of Representatives brings some of the most powerful and important gun-rights legislation since Congress. This change, if it is to be enacted will have a significant impact on the ability of states to pass legislation. It will also be in many ways a major blow to gun rights in the United States. The law is already under threat of being enforced in New York. More states are preparing to challenge it, however. More states, if the power to regulate guns has been weakened in the United States, could use this power to enact legislation. It is clear that gun rights will not be one-hitters. A veto on a bill like this is a threat to all of us. There is no reason that this should be so. It may be the right to take an axe down. What is likely to create a new threat in that is a veto for laws that are passed by every state in America.""

As we described earlier, the decision was limited in scope to the type of regulation that should include automatic locks to make that locks should be made by a person.

The law also requires the President to provide an exemption to a federal firearm purchase agreement for individuals who are injured or killed in some form of such shooting or reckless discharge. It also provides a clause in the bill to allow for the President to take steps that would otherwise be against federal law. It will allow the President to collect tax revenue from the sale of ammunition, ammo, and firearms, allowing the President to collect income. It is unlikely that the president will ever have the federal funds and the President would be powerless in the current situation.

In the case concerning weapons, this is the only argument that the Federal Bureau of Investigation will have against the purchase of any firearms. But the government is also unwilling to have access to the weapons, because the law does not authorize it. It does not have the capacity to obtain the necessary paperwork necessary for obtaining the necessary documents to obtain a firearm.

Congress does not have the capacity to take action against a firearm owner, even if the government's case is compelling. Instead of making a ruling on the legality of a firearm owner, Congress can simply issue a decision based upon the evidence in support of the question.

Here, however, the law is made up of the two components the government uses in this case. For the gun, these are elements that are needed in its application, as well as the various measures. For the gun, this is a two-part order, in effect, one to the effect of the need to make a decision on a person's status for carrying firearm - ""if the person is injured.""

The issue arises in the case of William F. Buckley Jr., Jr., a Democrat and former Attorney General. Feds may have a right to consider judicial decision in the case that would have an effect on the outcome of the investigation. As we have written, Feds use guns or are entitled to a right of life at the time they do so. In defending the right to use lethal force against mentally-impaired persons without reasonable suspicion that, for the purposes of the order, an individual may avoid using such force to prevent harm to a person. For the defense to consider those rights that would extend to the use of lethal force, would have to extend to a constitutional amendment of constitution.

"In Minneapolis, Looking for Police Recruits Who Can Resist Warrior Culture

By Andrew W. Olmstead and Karen Coles

April 12, 2013

A national investigation finds that an increasing number of Minneapolis police officers are holding their ground to take on a warlike past. While other officers and civilians may find their unions closer to home, Minneapolis cops who question liberal ideology are being attacked by Republicans and Democrats alike.

An organization called Minnesota Proud Workers was founded in the Minneapolis area in the mid-1970s to combat white nationalist sentiments. The 'happy right' movement erupted from the resentment of support for the Vietnam war. Organizers counter with film, organized drag races, and meet-and-greets that police departments around the country engage in.

To recognize their identity and future, Minnesota Proud workers raise the torch of democracy to stand up for the police, even though they are a minority. We believe law enforcement should exercise the right to utilize force as necessary for protecting people and to hold people accountable for actions they have taken or are contemplating when doing so.

Free cop documents obtained from the DOP and the May 2013 actions show that police tend to obey demagogic slogans, and they try to manipulate people into acting out racist epithets. The practices are arguably ugly and tasteless. Instead of reading laws that reflect the people's experience, they call for the mistreatment of them and their fellow officers.

The Chicago Police Department, which tried to organize the DOP's summer, is also denying the typical and lethal conduct of officers. They operate with impunity, putting on hoodies and spray tanors, clean break-ins, and riot gear. State and local agencies trying to investigate St. Paul, Kansas and Charlottesville, Virginia white supremacists are taking advantage of free cop programs like Free Mike, where police are often required to sit in the back of patrol cars for five hours per week to march and light block signs. The Carolina nationalists have proposed a form of segregation, legislation that would see frisking residents who were prohibited from driving would be stopped and left to fend for themselves for those who had a big enough heart, and slow dogs that weren't trained to sniff through garbage cans.

Even though tensions between black and white police officers have increased over the years, Minneapolis police are still resistant to allowing blacks and white officers to confront each other. The Pentagon complains about black soldiers being shot up in ""Uncle Tom's"" uniforms, but police officers continue to tell local business owners there is a discrepancy between in black-colored uniforms and well-disposed uniforms of cops. The backlash has been felt elsewhere. The Baton Rouge police department has protested without incident after officer Jason Steele refused to drop a black taser on a guy who was being chased by two white officers and was getting out of the car.

Moreover, for black officers, having a black officer around provides a safe zone between black officers and police. Because black officers have become accustomed to working in a law enforcement environment, the predominance of white police in law enforcement has made maintaining balance among law enforcement with peace and safety the primary goal of active police, putting lives at risk and ensuring officers are fully educated on routine policies for tactical use of force.

Therefore, we called for greater transparency from officers. This resulted in the situation that started at 4:45 on June 10, 2013, when I started taking pictures of everyday cops who were on my street, trying to get access to my home and stop every person for a man or woman who was not wearing a police uniform. More than 300 officers responded to that call, making 69 arrests.

Police have been accused of investigating officers for turning down police requests for help, so they didn't have an attorney. They have to find out which officer doesn't give them the time they want, which they don't want to give, and which one does. And the response that got more officers arrested for resisting arrest is never quick, as officers are told they can't get past that question by responding with a friendly glare that makes it appear law enforcement does not object to their appearance. Officers get that this often occurs because people who want to exercise their rights are constantly trying to intimidate and kick people down the street for being better and not being in the least bit racist.

Police duty is being left to your own devices. As an officer, I routinely arrest individuals for posting and/or",machine
"?Everybody Will Second-Guess?: Liberal Mayors Navigate Protesters and Police Shouts for Their Abuses of Free Speech For Very Long\

Several future U.S. Congress members will examine the record of free speech protections given to voters and police in the last two years, many of them elected and executive-elected. As Trump stepped into the White House last summer, most observers suggested that that Trump was attempting to delegitimize what has been the great chapter in American history in which a plurality of Americans, without taking such action, likely became ""different, more pro-persona."" Moreover, the contention that people like MSPH and UC Berkeley Republican lawmakers were ""anti-Constitutional"" is another attempt to legitimize police violence against protesters by further escalating the already high level of policing over the last few years.

Today, protests are springing up across the country, and there will be ""DUNDLE DAY 2017"" (Climate on Dumpsters). For political operatives like myself, the main question has always been what the next generation of progressives will look like. The ""billionaire class,"" whose image, for all of their presumptions about their economic status, necessarily offers plenty of spectacle, is very far from democratic. On the contrary, much of today's action?from trumpeting anti-Semitic remarks at the town hall meeting of the U.S. Senate to taking a stand against climate change?is directed at people who are not fully engaged.

My ideal audience for a new generation of ""dont listen"" progressives, today, is mostly working-class people who are facing the implications of voter suppression laws, the establishment political system, and a painful fear of greater police state repression of Black Lives Matter.

Last week I received an email from the Republican leadership in Congress from a constituent who had been torn between the result of his 2011 vote to ban Muslim immigration, and that of his 2010 vote to shut down an abortion clinic in Kansas. I asked him: ""Is Mr. Speaker even talking to you on whether your chief of staff dislikes Donald Trump's actions in this instance?""

In other words, is he really a ""social democratic"" politician like Senator Blumenauer or Representative Kevin Brady? How does Mr. Speaker respond, and how does he respond to the students protesting his public statements about banishing terrorists from this country? For one thing, for 15 minutes this morning in this office where I can see him engaging in an abundance of debate and rational deliberation, he was clearly irritated and was apologizing profusely, noting that for all his recent accomplishments?his prominence on the campus and his role as an ally?these students would not tolerate such harm in their lives and hearing him admit that is a deeply disturbing question to ask.

Some think this is true, as it seems to me, and that probably holds true with Mr. Speaker, who let some folks, even progressives like myself, fall into the trap of hiding their ignorance about the latest political and social pressures on their backyards and on our own, which is what is threatening our democracy.

Here is some of what he said about ""DUNDLE DAY 2017,"" among other things:

RUTH BARLETT: The law was enacted on 14 June 2016 and there were 17,000 abortions. We had about 15,000 public clinics during the last two years, over 10,000 abortions, 30,000 men, women.

SCOTLAND: And that had been covered in the last year. You know, I mean, I think that may be surprising to these students.

SANTORUM: Well, I think it's probably wrong to really listen to them about that. I mean, you know, all the students, the black students, were shocked and revolted.

RAMUEL BASSARD: Well, I think it's important to understand, as I did, that no one heard these students say that. I mean, I mean, I don't think they'd rather talk about these topics than talk about these conversations and say, well, you know, everybody would not like us doing these things.

GRACE: But they did come across an issue about contraception.

"Seattle City Council overrides mayor's veto of police cuts

More neighborhoods and community groups in Oakland are planning protests that have resulted in police closures for several days, after Occupy activists staged two planned march events Friday.

According to activists who reported being forced to evacuate a San Francisco apartment building on Saturday, police were unable to reach some of the city's injured people for an hour.

One person was taken to the hospital with burns, but was not hurt, as police moved in and were able to force officers to charge the apartment.

One protester told NBC 6 News that he heard a knocking at some doors but was moved toward the end of the night.

""They let us take off the clothes, what's that going to look like?""

A recent article described a group to the building as ""Flames"" and said:

""A group in the fourth floor of the building from a camera car, said a call to a police officer at 2:30 a.m. told them after the footage appeared that protesters were carrying out a curfew, they were attempting to negotiate with the building's residents over a simple amount of gas.

Officers from a group that was to visit the roof told local reporters that they had heard ""no response from either side, and that as soon as they did what had to be done"" they called the cops.

Another reporter also reported that a security guard of the Oakland Emergency Management Board told them that the officers would have to drop off a group of people who were trying to negotiate a few minutes and then the lights went out.

Police in other cities have had major infractions as of late in the day, including overzealous use of pepper-spraying and public drinking by cops.

Many of the city's residents who were prevented from seeking treatment include homeless who often have broken into homes or vehicles, officials said.

The city is also facing the possibility of eviction because of a report by a newspaper the newspaper had obtained recently that suggested that police were being used to evict a whole group from a parking lot where a homeless unit could be held, the paper reports.

A week ago, dozens of activists marched through downtown Oakland demanding support for a police strike.

The officer's legal name is being withheld from the media, major sources say

Washington (CNN) In what's being described as the worst day of his life, a Tacoma police officer has been fired, after his Twitter account mistakenly listed him as an FBI informant and also claimed to be a U-2 spy.

Sandy Docegve, an attorney representing the officer's family said in a Monday press release that the account ""will be withheld until further notice"" of the internal affairs investigations announced in February.

""I was upset that these tweets appeared as a malicious move, but was just an expression,"" Docegve wrote in the statement. ""My family wishes to thank him for the incredible support he has received. I also wish to thank the nation's finest law enforcement officer for his incredible bravery in confronting these outrageous allegations in the first place and for his ability to defend himself at court and defend others in this nation together.""

Docegve's legal name was redacted as officials attempted to block the release of the woman's account Monday morning after the Seattle Times attempted to obtain a court order for her to silence her on her role.

"After a third night of looting on Monday, June 1, New York governor Andrew Cuomo accurately observed: ?The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night. It was rampant looting across the city last night that they did not stop.? Cuomo?s comment spurred indignant replies from the New York City police commissioner and Mayor Bill de Blasio, who claimed that there was ?no such thing as being able to loot with impunity.?For once, Cuomo was right. Numerous videos on Twitter, Facebook, and elsewhere show people breaking into stores and then walking out with goods as police looked on passively. Police cars raced past shops being looted. Store owners recounted calling 911 to report that their stores were being broken into at that moment, and hearing that police were not available to come help.Why are the police simultaneously willing to attack peaceful marchers but so tolerant of looters? The answer certainly is not lack of officers, nor is it police incompetence. NYC has three times as many officers per capita as the US average. 8,000 cops were on the streets in NYC on the night of June 1 as the looting occurred. Whatever one can say about the New York City police, they are highly experienced in crowd control and at deploying forces to places they have identified as crime hotspots.Even if we grant that the police were surprised by the multiple and shifting points of protest on Saturday, May 30, the first night with looting, that can?t explain why the police adopted the same tactics on the following nights. From my window on lower Broadway in Manhattan, I witnessed night after night of police attacks on peaceful demonstrators. The police massed to stop the marches and used their clubs to push back the protesters. At the same time, the police made no effort at all to stop the small minority of demonstrators who turned down side streets and onto the neighboring avenues to break windows, or the unrelated criminals who took the opportunity to loot stores.Perhaps the first night?s unimpeded destruction could be attributed to miscalculation on the part of the police, but when they used the same tactics each night, leaving all streets except those with marches unpatrolled, it seems obvious that vandalism and looting were the desired outcome. For the police, each broken window and looted store serves the double purpose of delegitimizing the demonstrators and building fear among the city?s residents that will lead to calls for ?unleashing? the police and increasing their budget ? or so the cops hope and expect.In essence, the New York City police went on strike. They continued to do the work they enjoyed or at least were committed to doing, such as hitting and arresting demonstrators or confiscating their personal property, while refusing to protect the rest of the city.Police officers are showing their attitudes toward the protesters as they arrest people who in other instances would be left alone or just issued summons for walking in the street instead of on the sidewalk, unlawful assembly, or being out after curfew. The police took days rather than the usual few hours to complete the paperwork needed to bring those arrested before judges so they could be released, leaving demonstrators to languish in crowded cells where they were at high risk of being exposed to COVID-19.While brutalizing many demonstrators and entering some into a de facto COVID-19 death-penalty lottery, the police stopped doing the work that the public imagines it is buying with the almost $6 billion spent on the NYPD each year. The broken windows and looted stores we woke up to each morning last week were a direct message from the police to public officials and to voters at large. The police in essence said: ?If you challenge us, if you insult us, we will no longer protect you.?The police are not literally on strike. They show up for work and get paid. But they are refusing to meet the expectations of their job. Of course, the police aren?t the only workers to engage in slowdowns or sabotage. Strikes are costly for workers, and few workers or unions have the resources to sustain long strikes. Slowdowns and sabotage can be just as disruptive as fully fledged strikes and are harder for employers to counter. Often such actions win quick concessions.This is not the first police slowdown. From December 2014 through January 2015, the NYPD almost entirely stopped making arrests and issuing summonses. Their goal then was to intimidate the newly inaugurated mayor Bill de Blasio, who had campaigned on a platform of ending stop and frisk and instituting civilian review of police misconduct.The pressure worked. De Blasio abandoned his plans to create external monitors of the police, and we see the results in the mayor?s current praise for the police, despite their violence and lack of effort to prevent actual crimes.Conversely, the police reward oppressive and racist policies with hard work. When Rudolph Giuliani was mayor, the police worked harder at making arrests than ever before. That effort was their tribute to a man who had campaigned on a law-and-order platform, cheered on police when they directed racist insults at the previous mayor, David Dinkins, and instituted the policy of stop and frisk.What are the lessons to be drawn from this and previous police strikes? First, strikes work. And they are even more effective when backed by strong unions that are able to mobilize their members, articulate grievances, and pressure employers or government officials (who in the case of the police are one and the same). Police officers? willingness and ability to use leverage should be an example for all workers.However, we need to be careful not to imagine that police officers are our allies. The police almost never refuse orders to arrest picketers from other unions, and they are often happy to accept bigger budgets and higher salaries even when their fellow municipal workers are being laid off.If the police are so powerful, what can we do to rein them in and eliminate their capacity to act as racists and inflict violence at will? Unfortunately, voting for Democrats indiscriminately will not solve the problem. Many of the most violent and racist police forces are in cities that have been governed by Democrats for decades, such as Minneapolis, Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, and St Louis.Joe Biden?s suggestion that police be trained to shoot people in the leg instead of the heart is typical of the Democrats: it highlights their deference to the police, and their love for technocratic solutions and ?conversations? that create the illusion rather than the substance of change.We need to begin with the realization that police forces as currently constituted are not amenable to reform. We see that in Minneapolis, where it turns out that Derek Chauvin ? the officer who placed his knee on George Floyd?s neck for eight minutes, forty-six seconds, killing him ? was the ?training officer? for two of the other officers on the scene.It is bad enough that the Minneapolis Police Department kept on Chauvinÿafter eighteen prior complaints. But to select such an officer as mentor to rookies reveals a rot in that city?s police that can only be overcome with wholesale restructuring, or perhaps by dismissing the entire force and beginning again.We can take comfort from the fact that police play little role in determining the crime rate. When the NYPD went on their slowdown in 2014?15, crime actually went down, not up. We need to push to defund the police. This has to be at the center of what we demand of candidates for local office. In Democratic-run cities, we can run candidates in Democratic primaries who are committed to defunding, and if that fails, support third-party candidates. However, as the example of de Blasio makes clear, finding good candidates and getting them elected is not enough.We will need to engage in repeated direct action and be clear on our demands. The police have to be demilitarized. Police forces need to stop accepting surplus military weaponry and get rid of what they already have. For the most part, police should be replaced with volunteers who reflect and will respond to the needs of their neighborhoods. We need to elect district attorneys who will not defer to police, and who see reducing the incarceration rate as their central goal. The rapid accomplishments of recently elected progressive DAs in Philadelphia, Boston, San Francisco, Houston, and elsewhere are examples of the importance of targeting that office.We must remember that for the most part, local governments control the police, and this is the level that is most vulnerable to popular mobilization and least easily dominated by the rich and their campaign spending. If we sustain the current high level of awareness and continue to protest, we can achieve major changes. Such victories will show that political action can produce victories that matter for people?s everyday lives, and thereby encourage further mobilization on other issues by people who both are the main victims of the police and often the most disengaged from politics.",human
"Dermot Shea: Defunding the police in NYC had a'significant impact' on crime surge

However, the US president's former colleague revealed that the police have increased their use of force against the foreign victims after his 2016 election campaign. The London Police Department has since increased the use of police in its country. The following year, white collar crime dropped 6 per cent in the west Midlands and 10 per cent in the south of England. The recent increase in force from police is particularly ominous given the commitment of the Occupy movement to the cause. The meeting was attended by more than 200 police in 76 countries. In reaction to the revelations, some claims of police 'acknowledge to provide details' have been rejected.

An analysis of Police Data Centre data sets from 2009-2012 by the National Crime Agency revealed that between January 2014 and January 2015, 100,422 cases were criminalised for failure to report a crime against their own, taking a total of 159,211 convictions. The formality of that operation follows similar figures at the end of 2012 and remains public.

The Metropolitan Police released a report in 2016 claiming that 'police districts are a major source of success for police communities in breaking down crime figures into discrete areas'.

The analysis, performed by MP Ben Reid at Brown University's School of Criminology and Crime Science, claims that the police overall come into play a large part in making up the law and taking action to reduce crime. ""There is a large majority of the world's population living in countries that are living with, and under constant threat from, violent crime. Most of these cities are predominantly black and its defenders often retain large swathes of these communities. The result of such battle-tested policies of policing who hold specific skills, and, often, tactical skills, both directly and indirectly in line with some of these fundamental values, has been a significant increase in the number of reports of violent crime by police over the past five years.""

His latest analysis gives a new perspective on the success of policing, describing the community of change and identifying factors that can contribute to it.

Tory leader Naomi Wolf has branded the police's ""insider role"" of policing 'ugly'. She has voiced concerns over the lack of plans for internal policing and calls for a 'global perspective' on policing.

Reflecting on that background and providing an opinion on law and policing, she explained how every single subject is different and there is an academic consensus on the arguments of those who defend police agencies.

A rigorous case-study conducted by Professor Tanya Sale, who developed the methodology described above for this article, gave a strong justification for how policing relates to crime. Professor Sale noted that since police departments across the country are under-represented in their departments, he said it was likely that their priority is to keep crime under control, and that creating effective social networks can be both a key 'role model' and productive tools for solving crime.

"LOS ANGELES ? It?s a moment that mayors can still describe, months or years later. The first time they get the call: A police officer has killed someone, often that person is black or Latino, and a neighborhood is enraged.What happens next is often one of the most consequential political balancing acts in American governance. The mayors of America?s larger cities, nearly all members of the Democratic Party and some of whom are black or Latino themselves, must reckon with political priorities that appear in conflict ? living up to their rhetoric as champions of marginalized communities while maintaining a close working relationship with police departments often accused of inflicting harm.?It?s a challenge,? said Mayor Michael Tubbs of Stockton, Calif., a Democrat who is the city?s first black mayor and, at 29, its youngest. ?You?re part of the group that has been historically oppressed by government, and then you?re in charge of trying to make the government work.?He described the challenge in biblical terms: ?For some folks, they expect me to be Moses and, with my hands up, say ?Peace? and everyone goes quiet.?As dozens of mayors nationwide now confront nightly protests and huge police deployments in their streets, even Democrats who ran on a platform of police reform and community engagement are trying to balance support for law enforcement with their continuing commitment to change. Last week, after destructive protests erupted across the country in response to the death of George Floyd, a black man who was killed in police custody in Minneapolis, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City said the police there had showed ?a lot of restraint.? In Los Angeles, where a peaceful protest turned to mayhem on Saturday night, Mayor Eric Garcetti angered some progressives when he called in the National Guard, just hours after he said doing so was unnecessary.?Everybody will second-guess,? Mr. Garcetti said on Monday, referring not just to the decision to call in the Guard, but also to the police tactics that included using tear gas and arresting peaceful protesters who refused to move. He said that complaints of police misconduct during the protests would be investigated. ?We?ve all read the history books,? he said.In interviews with more than a dozen Democrats who currently or have previously served as local leaders in high-populated areas, they describe a complex web of political incentives that shape the relationship between mayor and law enforcement, and can turn the candidate with the most liberal reform promises into a conservative champion of law and order once in office.For some, police autonomy was a necessary cost of maintaining public safety, and of pleasing rank-and-file officers and more moderate voters. Others described a network of shared political consequences that make it hard for a mayor to upset key groups ? the police, police unions, local prosecutors and others ? particularly if City Hall is seen as a step to higher office.Larry Krasner, the district attorney in Philadelphia who ran on a reform platform, said local leaders are generally afraid to cross police unions, because of the political clout the unions hold.?Being close to the leadership of the police union means, ?Do you have our back??? he said. ?Which really means, ?Do you have our back more than you have the back of your citizens???Juli n Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio who made police misconduct a centerpiece of his presidential campaign last year, said city officials should be doing more on police reform.In his view, many local Democrats are more focused on supporting police unions than considering possible harm done to black and Latino residents.?There?s a detachment from this issue that needs to change,? he said.Since the emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2013, perhaps no issue has caused more friction between Democratic elected officials and the party?s activist base than criminal justice and policing. During her 2016 presidential bid, Hillary Clinton was prodded to embrace systemic reforms to policing, and so has former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the party?s presumptive 2020 nominee. Candidates in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary race, which represented a historically diverse field, were repeatedly pushed on the issue, often by younger black and Latino activists. The fights between progressive insurgents and Democratic incumbents in the House have used criminal justice reform as a wedge.But in the past week, as a wave of unrest has consumed cities across the United States, Democratic mayors are increasingly in the spotlight. President Trump on Monday night threatened to deploy the military if mayors do not ?establish an overwhelming presence until the violence is quelled.? The careful calibration of liberal leaders, between projecting empathy for the protesters and denouncing property destruction and theft, shows their progressive ideals being put to a high-stakes practical test. Some of the mayors navigating this turbulence came of age well after the tumult of the 1960s and are fluent in the language of social activism, seeking a way to stand out from their predecessors.Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta announced on Sunday that two officers were fired and three others were demoted after a video captured by local news media showed them pulling a woman from her car and using a stun gun on another man. Mayor Greg Fischer of Louisville fired the city?s police chief on Monday, after learning that police officers did not record body camera footage during the fatal shooting of a black business owner, David McAtee, that took place that day.Though mayors have repeatedly condemned vandalism, fewer have spoken critically of the police officers? conduct, despite public outcry.?The concerns are legitimate and deserve attention, and the majority of people who are protesting are doing so peacefully,? said Mayor Kate Gallego of Phoenix. ?But as a mayor I feel like I have to say we cannot stand for violence, that setting trees on fire and burning cars is not the answer.?In Los Angeles, where people have marched downtown and in the Fairfax neighborhood in recent days, the events of 1992 are never far from memory. In the decades since the uprising that followed the acquittal of the four officers who beat Rodney King, the Los Angeles Police Department has instituted many reforms, earning support from activists who were once vocal critics. But the department has faced several protests after officer-involved shootings in recent years. Still, Mr. Garcetti said in an interview that most large cities lag behind in adopting similar changes.?We have to figure out a way to humanize both sides of the barricades right now,? he said. ?First and foremost, to humanize black people in this country who have disproportionately been dehumanized. But it can?t ever be a one-way street to dehumanize a person who wears a badge. We need them to hear us, but we need to hear them or else we?re going to isolate them into islands that results in the sort of policing we don?t want to see.?Jane Castor, the mayor of Tampa, Fla., spent more than two decades in the Police department there, eventually rising to become chief ? a key part of her appeal as a political leader.?I don?t know that there is any one person or any one group that despises police brutality more than police officers,? Ms. Castor said in an interview. ?As a community we need to acknowledge that George Floyd was murdered, that those actions constituted homicide and then to also recognize and try to understand the pain that is being felt in the black and brown communities.?On Monday afternoon, Mr. Biden held a virtual round table with Mr. Garcetti, Ms. Bottoms, Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago and Mayor Melvin Carter of St. Paul, Minn. The former vice president said he sympathized with protesters? concerns but also denounced ?violence that endangers lives and guts local businesses is no way forward.?Ms. Lightfoot, who faced some criticism during her 2018 mayoral run about her record of police accountability as leader of the Chicago Police Board, said mayors supported peaceful expression of dissent but were focused on rooting out bad officers. ?Look, we?ve had our fair share of dark days in Chicago around police violence and shooting,? she said. ?But I do think it?s important for us to not allow forces of darkness to conflate people?s righteous anger and need to express themselves in their protected First Amendment rights.?Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba of Jackson, Miss., said it was time for the party to embrace not just police reform, but ?deconstructing the criminal justice system.? Mr. Lumumba, 37, said even if this moment seemed like a flash point, the inequities, racism and despair that create the tension run much deeper.?There?s an economic reliance on the system of policing,? Mr. Lumumba said. ?You have more police today than you ever had. You have city police, county police, state police, federal police, secret police, secret police that watch the secret police. You have probation and parole officers, prison guards, companies that contract out with the prison.??We rely on the overincarceration of our society,? he said.Crime control bills helmed by Mr. Biden in the late 1980s and early 1990s helped transform the relationship between local, state, and federal justice systems. In Monday?s round table with mayors, Mr. Biden said public officials needed to reckon with police brutality, citing the ?incredible pain and legitimate anger that is the root of these protests.?This was not always his position. In a 1994 speech on the Senate floor, Mr. Biden was unequivocal ? more police officers made people safer.?Anybody who does not want cops, then do not ask for them; send them my way,? he said at the time. ?Send them to Philadelphia, Wilmington, Trenton, the area I live in. And my daughter will be safer, my wife will be safer, my mother will be safer, and I will be safer. And I will be happy.?Jennifer Medina reported from Los Angeles, and Astead W. Herndon from Columbia, S.C.",human
"These cities have begun defunding police in the wake of George Floyd protests. It's my sense that they have more bias against white people in this area.

There are a lot of grievances with the police and for themselves. But you also have to work on the law. And in an era in which the rich are determined to profit from the lives of blacks ? which it certainly does ? it's always easy to feel like the police have no job. But white police officers should not be discriminated against as a result of their race.


SARA HAYRICH: And your suggestion that the influx of white officers to New York is primarily concerned with corruption and the holding of guns in the city and with it putting off younger men ? it seems to me the point of the reports like these is that they are driving up a profile. Who are these young men who were told to go off patrol and not to leave, or were questioned in this fashion, and have nothing to do with policing them?


KAREN MARKEY: I don't know why they need to be there, what's most troubling about it, I think, is that we're actually seeing more black arrests in Brooklyn. Of the 2,300 and maybe 3,000 white arrests there this year, we've actually lost half of them to charges that are much lower than what you had in the city.


I think there are a lot of factors that go into the question of whether the fact that people were breaking the law a little bit, of what happened to those of us who were breaking the law for not policing in those cases is actually problematic. That's a problem that I think is the core of the issue.

So it would be in a, like, grey area for police officers to go there and face those people ? who are that age?

SARA HAYRICH: Well, we're trying to address it when we can. But it's already been a problem for a long time now, because of the way that the cops arrested people. All sorts of economic changes that have been going on that have impacted more people.

The police, of course, have learned through experience, across police departments and across the country, that unless we change our way of dealing with people that are not police officers, that they don't feel welcome and that they can't help themselves, that if there was an officer with a badge, on the street who was so rude, who didn't respect him, or in an altercation, to provoke somebody, or a confrontation that was going on, then maybe there wouldn't be much there.

But at least police officers know that sometimes there's something wrong with someone or there are people that we don't want on our street, so they're sort of pushing to get that guy out.

SARA HAYRICH: So, you've kind of, like ? let's talk about this on your second issue. What does that mean?

KAREN MARKEY: The federal government, as of right now, wants to help the police break up political protest in New York City.

So they want to give police more resources and better oversight. So what's happened is that the local boards of police have given 10 percent more money to the NYPD, it's been given $100 million more this year, and they have joined together with other departments, local organizations and state, federal and state police officers, who are working in cooperation with local law enforcement, to pass legislation that will make sure the police can go back to policing their neighborhoods and make sure that people won't be stopped or punished.

And they're doing it because this is how the law was meant to work, and this is how the people that they're protecting had to live with that. That would be kind of what made them dangerous to this community.

But you have to think about it as some kind of statutory decision that will be made after the fact and will be made after the fact for city officials, within police departments.

So they're not supposed to be playing politics anymore.

SARA HAYRICH: Thank you.

KAREN MARKEY: Hello.

SARA HAYRICH: George Floyd. How are you feeling now?

KAREN MARKEY: That's good.",machine
"Minneapolis Police Experience Surge of Departures in Aftermath of George Floyd Protests

Over the course of a month of fighting and protests that have since erupted and turned into cat havoc, hundreds of Minneapolis residents have been arrested and more arrested. These numbers are just a snapshot of how many arrests a community or state has been swept up as a result of Minnesota's controversial ban on ""hate crime."" Minnesota was the first state to enact a ban on the carrying of any type of firearm.

It's the only area of major metropolitan area that Minneapolis is currently debating. Despite a recent drop in anti-Muslim and anti-anti-gay sentiments, many Minneapolisans haven't spoken on social media.

The city hasn't just had the same sort of crisis ? at least in part. In this climate of fear, a significant portion of Minneapolis locals have taken it upon themselves to be a target with a clear grievance message.

As an example of what would seem like a good name for the city of Minnesota ? and, more recently, people of color ? this is simply not acceptable to Minneapolis residents.

The first thing to put on the tongue is this: it was a very controversial decision, and a great deal of conversation has taken place on the case.

The city believes hate crime is caused by bigotry and that is, indeed, what resulted in its decision to ban it.

And there is no doubt that a large portion of people of color were targeted for ""hate crimes"" and that they were targeted for being Muslims in Minnesota.

The city of Minnesota sees this as a particularly good example of the phenomenon. This decision, if it had followed the case as it does in other major areas of the state, would have sent a clear message to the nation that a law that forbids racially or ethnically motivated harassment over mass reporting is ""racist.""

The next best thing to come out of the ruling is to hear Minneapolis residents speak about why hate crime isn't being treated all the way in the media. ""It's just not happening,"" one woman to another said.

""When you have someone who is an Asian and Latino, and you see that they were abused at a mosque, you have to just say it, and we are going to be okay,"" another person to another said.

Even then, it's worth looking at the evidence ? for what it means to hate crime, and why it continues to take place.

It's not just one woman who is targeted for a hate crime, the others are all the more hurtful by the decision.

When it comes to the case of the Minneapolis-based anti-gay marriage repeal and the recent anti-abortion state of Indiana, a new report shows a huge number of Minneapolis residents have been targeted by hate crime and discrimination.

The report found that a total of 44 Minneapolis residents ? including 22 male and 19 female ? have been killed or have been injured, with one person making it to hospital-wide between six and seven times. (Of those cases, one person was killed, while the second was a second person)

The report also found that a substantial majority of people in the entire state have been forced from their jobs by anti-abortion discrimination.

The report calls on the entire community of Minneapolis to fight for this particular measure.

A report published in 2012 by the Twin Cities and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees shows it is a significant factor in the way people speak about hate crime. A similar report was published in 2011 by the National Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Hate crime.

While this country has a long history of hatred of gays and lesbians, it lacks the means or means to effectively address it.

For example, the Twin Cities and the American Alliance of State, County and Municipal Employees report also found that nearly half of people in the Twin Cities have experienced domestic violence since the law passed.

More broadly, it also cited anti-discrimination policies that prohibited gender-based harassment and said that sexual discrimination should be treated against people who are not married.

But in the same report that is cited by the Minneapolis Star Tribune, one Minnesota Republican legislator said the Twin Cities and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees report ""hate crime"" is an example of how the issue needs to improve.

""I think it is not the message that the Twin Cities and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees are making here that that sort of thing can get a lot of attention in the United States,"" Minnesota's Rep. Eric Swalwell said on radio and television.

""We do not understand why they are being treated like this,"" Swalwell said.

In fact, that may be why some lawmakers in the Twin Cities and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees have been pushing instead to stop the anti-hate laws ? such as the anti-marriage bill enacted in Minnesota last year.

However, when it comes to the anti-discrimination laws being introduced in Minneapolis, I can only find",machine
"Seattle City Council approves plan to defund police department, slashes jobs and salaries

More neighborhoods and cities are starting to implement public libraries that have started using and improving public libraries, according to a report released today by Public Arts Council.

According to the report, there were a number of community service goals ? a need that expanded libraries, libraries, libraries and other institutions across the city to include public spaces more affordable by making services more inclusive and integrating them more freely.

""Our goal is to provide them with the ability to take care of their lives, their communities, their schools and their businesses and their communities as well as provide them with a safe, secure and familiar environment,"" said City Councilwoman Melissa Harris, who is the report's lead author. ""We look forward to working with the city and other partners on their goals, including the cities of San Diego, Berkeley, Baltimore, Raleigh County, Jacksonville, and Albuquerque, N.M.""

There have been more than 80,000 protests for changes, from eliminating of city parking lots to banning ""unions"" who disrupt businesses for breaking parking lots, as well as creating an issue around overpass parking, a charge passed by the city.

A large number of the ""City of San Diego Public Library System"" has taken steps to implement, and city managers, to offer assistance and outreach to citizens of different city regions, or the areas surrounding those areas.

""On this day it is our belief that we can solve the library's challenges,"" said City Councilwoman Melissa Harris. ""Our greatest challenge ? and we are a public library system ? is to have our services, our branches and our libraries available,"" she said.

The city's library system would use funding provided by the state Legislature and other public entities, where it is based. Those funding opportunities come from those grants.

""Sacramento needs to know that City Libraries are going to participate by being provided an educational library,"" said Seattle Public Library director Kate Taylor in a statement. ""These services are not necessary to solve all of San Diego's problems, but I believe the city is committed to being provided these resources.""

Other local public libraries remain closed by the library as the council passed ordinances, including the one in the city of Oakland, which was closed in January.

Public libraries are the majority of San Diego's public buildings, with five libraries, or two of six in San Diego: the three schools, the nonprofit Public Library of San Diego, and three public locations.

Proposition 1, Proposition 2 proposed by the Los Angeles County (LAX) Division of Public Services, would have replaced the local Public Library system with a regional agency to maintain and expand the services. It would have increased the tax base by $3.1 million, and the state would be offering a tax-exempt ""libraries tax neutral"" to make money to restore these libraries.

A federal grant support system, with funds given for improving public libraries in general and supporting the preservation and renewal of those institutions, is one way to keep these libraries in the public good hands.

Proposition 3, proposed by the Los Angeles County (LAX) Division of Public Services, would have extended and enhanced the existing system's existing scope of service.

San Diego County is still recovering from a public library shutdown and needs support from several cities and regions to take this significant step.

A few years ago, the San Diego County Library began looking at the community service, which it had designated as a local institution. If enough people contribute, they will help spread out the cause, but will not be able to organize the work of larger libraries. These organizations may need to hire or consider other local government agencies to participate.

Under the proposal, the County could grant the city of Phoenix (PAFI), also called the San Diego Library System, a regional group dedicated to promoting the arts and community values of their urban city, or any state-funded institution supporting the project.

""In the last year, our local public library was very focused on the arts and creativity of our community,"" said Steve Breski, Mesa County Library system director. ""We don't want to be seen to be the last person at a library library.""

The City Council now is considering an initiative to provide more funding to various public local institutions such as the city of Phoenix, one that includes three in Santa Ana, San Diego, San Diego, and downtown.

But the proposal cannot go live for a year because the city council must support it by Aug. 30, or else it will need to approve additional funding.

If Phoenix wants to go by the letter of the law so that it can move forward with an additional requirement that libraries maintain these facilities and services over any period of the year, it must pay $10,000 toward the funds.

""We want to use this opportunity to create an arts institution, but if that institution fails to comply with all state requirements, and even the minimum requirements,"" said Councilwoman Laura Taylor.

"Atlanta Mayor Tightens Rules on When Police Can Use Force

Photo Credit: file photo

Meet Detroit Police Chief William Bratton.

On Sunday, Bratton vowed to make it easier for protesters to picket during the event, and to get in line to show support for his claim that Bratton has engaged in a ""moronic rant.""

SPONSORED

""He made it clear that he would lead by example and say clearly when it comes to the Occupy movement that the police can't use force,"" Bratton told the crowd, amid the crowd applauding his impromptu response. ""I think in the comments he made at the time I think it's a lot more beautiful to stand up for his beliefs that people have learned to follow the law and live their lives as they do.""

Bratton blamed left-wing activists for blocking the event, both criticizing his police-community relations effort and praising the National Lawyers Guild.

""This event gives police and residents a reason to stop wherever they go, and why not engage with them to see if the messages we're sending may be a great way to get people to stop their rally,"" Bratton said in a separate news release. ""I hope that if we show unity we can inspire more people to stand up for our values at this historic event and hope that one day, we can help those that are out there stop themselves and stand up for one another.""

Bratton and the National Lawyers Guild signed a two-year civil-rights trade association contract with the White House in 2009, but several city attorneys have declined to participate in political campaigns outside the law enforcement union, as is the norm for most civil-rights agreements.

Don't be too surprised if protesters turn up at Bratton's rally to protest his order against protesters who are protesting for a way to shut down the police. A spokesman for the White House denied any requests from Bratton for Twitter photos and photos.

"PORTLAND, Ore. ? Terrance Moses was watching protesters against police brutality march down his quiet residential street one recent evening when some in the group of a few hundred suddenly stopped and started yelling.Mr. Moses was initially not sure what the protesters were upset about, but as he got closer, he saw it: His neighbors had an American flag on display.?It went from a peaceful march, calling out the names, to all of a sudden, bang, ?How dare you fly the American flag??? said Mr. Moses, who is Black and runs a nonprofit group in the Portland, Ore., area. ?They said take it down. They wouldn?t leave. They said they?re going to come back and burn the house down.?Mr. Moses and others blocked the demonstrators and told them to leave.?We don?t go around terrorizing folks to try and force them to do something they don?t want to do,? said Mr. Moses, whose nonprofit group provides support for local homeless people. ?I?m a veteran. I?m for these liberties.?Nearly four months after the killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police, some protesters against police brutality are taking a more confrontational ? and personal ? approach. The marches in Portland are increasingly moving to residential and largely white neighborhoods, where demonstrators with bullhorns shout for people to come ?out of your house and into the street? and demonstrate their support.These more aggressive protests target ordinary people going about their lives, especially those who decline to demonstrate allegiance to the cause. That includes a diner in Washington who refused to raise her fist to show support for Black Lives Matter, or, in several cities, confused drivers who happened upon the protests.But the tactics are dividing supporters of Black Lives Matter, with some worried that the confrontational approach will antagonize people who would be otherwise be receptive to the message, or play into conservatives? critique of the protests, which have been largely nonviolent nationally.Others, frustrated that little has changed since Mr. Floyd was killed, say that sitting idly and watching a protest without participating nowadays is to show tacit support for racism.?We don?t need allies anymore,? said Stephen Green, an investor and entrepreneur in Portland who is Black. ?We need accomplices.?In Rochester, N.Y., protesters have confronted people at outdoor restaurants, shaking dinner tables. Marchers in Washington also accosted people eating outside, urging everyone to raise their fists to show their allegiance to the movement.The more personal tactics echo those being used against elected officials, with activists showing up not only outside mayor?s offices but their homes as well. The apartment building where the mayor of Portland lives has been vandalized. Protesters lit fires outside, ignited fireworks and broke into one of the businesses in the building on his birthday. In San Jose, Calif., demonstrators graffitied and egged the mayor?s house and lit an American flag in front of it, according to the police. In Rochester, people have recently posted police officers? home addresses and information about their families, according to a police spokeswoman.In Portland, Jessie Burke, a local business owner who has Chinese ancestry and identifies as biracial, said the message of the movement was getting lost as the protests escalate and target ordinary residents in their homes.?Everyone was looking for solutions at first, but now it?s just a nightly fight that has gotten progressively more violent ? and every neighborhood worries that the fight will come to their neighborhood,? Ms. Burke said. ?It?s: ?Wake up, wake up, you need to be in the street protesting if you stand for this.??Still, Mr. Green argued that the tactics were working, even as they inconvenienced him and his family. He described the smell of tear gas and wail of sirens as the marches came to his neighborhood, which he said kept his 7-year-old daughter awake.?It?s one thing if you can see something on TV, but if you can hear it and you can smell it in your house, that brings it home,? said Mr. Green, who grew up in Portland. ?We need people willing to say, ?I?m down to lose this friend because stuff needs to change. I?m down to make my neighbor uncomfortable.? Being nice wasn?t changing anything.?Lindsey E. Murphy agreed. She marched with the protesters through one of Portland?s wealthiest neighborhoods on a recent night and found it deeply moving. She watched white demonstrators shouting at white residents that Black lives matter ? and the residents joining in with the chant.?The crowd was ? I won?t even say mostly white ? I?ll say it was an almost exclusively white crowd marching through the whitest neighborhood in Portland shouting ?Black lives matter? and ?Black lives are magic,?? said Ms. Murphy, who is Black and hosts an educational children?s YouTube series. ?What I was witnessing was a lamenting prayer, a cry of remorse and shame among the white people. That?s what I saw. It was healing.?The American flag that generated controversy is displayed in Kenton, a neighborhood of Portland with small bungalows, lush front gardens and ripe fruit trees. Weeks after the confrontation, the husband and wife who fly the flag said they were fearful of retaliation from the roving protesters, who had found their phone number.But they say they will not be intimidated into removing the flag.?I will not take my flag down,? said the husband, who declined to provide his name in a brief interview.The same night the protesters came to the couple?s door last month, they marched into Kenton?s commercial district and used restaurant picnic tables as fuel for fires. They collected the colorful wooden dividers the neighbors had recently built for outdoor dining and set those ablaze as well. Mr. Moses and others in the community ran into the protests with fire extinguishers.Protesters that night broke into the Portland Police Association building and set it on fire. A man was later seen scrubbing the sidewalk graffiti ? a popular message was ?PPB = KKK,? meaning that the Portland Police Bureau is the Ku Klux Klan.Mr. Green said that he opposed the destruction of property, but that he also understood it. And he believes, generally, that the more direct protest tactics in residential areas are working because they make the movement more personal, and reveal who truly supports change. If someone is against the movement, they keep their lights off or refuse to raise their fist, he said, adding that taking the debate into homes and to families is essential.Some residents in Portland say the tactics are escalating as the protests become increasingly dominated by white people, including anarchists and supporters of antifa, the diffuse collection of militant left-wing activists that has a strong presence in the region.The movement is splintered in Portland between more mainstream Black Lives Matter marches and the more aggressive, sometimes chaotic antifa or black bloc protests, where demonstrators dress in black and wear motorcycle helmets or ski masks to make it difficult to identify ? or later prosecute ? them.One night this month, there were two protests promoted on the Black Lives Matter Portland Events page: a ?nonviolent protest? in the city center and ?an autonomously organized direct action march.?No one appeared to be at the city center protest. But around 200 people were at the other event.They gathered in an unlit park in a residential neighborhood around 8 p.m. Everyone wore black, including some protesters who had on body armor and motorcycle helmets. They hastily set up picnic tables and supply booths in the dark, using cellphones for light to showcase their goods. There was a food table overflowing with protein bars and Monster energy drinks.A small free literature selection was set up on the grass and overseen by three people in ski masks. It was a popular offering, and people crowded around, craning to see the pamphlets.Titles included ?Why Break Windows?; ?I Want To Kill Cops Until I?m Dead?; ?Piece Now, Peace Later: An Anarchist Introduction to Firearms?; ?In Defense of Smashing Cameras?; and ?Three-Way Fight: Revolutionary Anti-Fascism and Armed Self Defense.?The energy was something like a carnival in the dark.?Paint balloons, get your paint balloons,? someone barked.But around 9:30, the group was in some organizational chaos. They had decided that the neighborhood close by was too racially diverse for them to protest in. They needed to go somewhere whiter.So the protesters caravaned 20 minutes away to Alberta, a more affluent neighborhood that began being gentrified in the 1990s. They reassembled and marched through the streets.Neighbors in impressive Craftsman-style homes pulled down their shades and turned off their lights, though many could be seen peering out of dark windows. One woman stepped out of an expansive home looking angry; upon seeing the crowd, she quickly retreated indoors. A few young couples stood in their doorways. A Black woman driving past honked and cheered.One white man stepped onto his patio clapping and hollering in support of the passing march. The group called for him to join. He smiled and waved them on, still clapping. They began to chant that he was spineless. He looked worried. But the march moved along, and he went back into his house.?You?ll never sleep tight, we do this every night,? the protesters chanted.",human

The government does not respond.<|endoftext|>The US Congress on Wednesday approved the first round of EPA cuts in decades to protect health care.

The bill authored by the outgoing Senator John Kerry, Republican of Massachusetts, and approved by a panel of 30 senators will cut more than 80,000 US health insurance regulations from last year, as part of negotiations with insurers to cut services or regulations for insurers.

The plans include increasing deductibles, eliminating coverage requirements for a specific group of care providers.

A senior administration official in Obama's administration said in a statement that ObamaCare's rules were in line with the bill's goals. The bill would eliminate a number of unnecessary regulations leading to cost increases.

""This is really a very simple proposal for reform,"" Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said.

The bill included a provision that would have been enacted by the end of the current term on March 23, the end of the current term. It contains several provisions about health care benefits such as coverage for the pre-existing conditions needed if a federal plan had to be revised.

However, the legislation contains no language about what it means to be a full part of the federal health insurance mandate.

""The bill has no purpose or role, but provides a provision that we all agree is in the best interest of people,"" Interior Department spokesman Nick Malasseur told POLITICO.

""The proposal is not a bill that could pass the Senate.""

Other senators in the Senate, including Sens. John McCain of Arizona and John McCain of Arizona, have called for changes to the bill but have not pushed to consider it, as the Senate bill did last week.

""This proposal is not designed to advance the interests of Americans in general and is very flawed from a partisan standpoint,"" McCain, a Republican, said in the statement.

The Senate bill would also include an additional $70 billion to fund the administration's proposed expansion of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

The proposed budget would raise taxes on corporations for the first time in years. It would also provide $1.4 billion for the administration to pay for a proposed tax reform in 2015.

And it would fund programs funded by federal grant money, such as Social Security and Medicare, to help small businesses.

The changes would increase revenues by 6.7 percent while increasing premiums for people with pre-existing conditions by $10 million. The GOP bill would also allow states for individuals with pre-existing conditions to remain in their insurance coverage for a year, but leave a large number of people without insurance.

Republicans have said Obamacare would have killed the Affordable Care Act.

The new funding bill would raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations as well as reduce taxes on working family members and elderly citizens, reducing income taxes for the top 1 percent and cutting spending on police departments.

The House GOP budget bill passed by a bipartisan 98-2 vote last week would have cut taxes for the top 1 percent of earners and trimmed benefits for those with incomes under $150,000.

The new budget also requires the Senate to pass a $1 billion deficit budget last fall and is expected to add $4.4 billion in tax breaks over the next three years.

Under the new budget, the administration would have to cut taxes on a large part of the country's $26 trillion in gross domestic product, which is about 8.2 percent of the total amount tax revenue generated from 2013-16.

Senate Democrats said the proposed $400 billion for high-income households and $320 billion for high-income households should include increases to Medicaid, which provides health insurance coverage for low-income Americans.

But Republicans argued that the new budget was not enough to protect the health care system from Trump administration cuts. They argued that Medicaid has contributed to the collapse in health insurance premiums due to the Affordable Care Act. That was the conclusion of Kaiser Family Foundation and the foundation's annual Health Freedom Awards for 2016.

Health Freedom Awards for 2016 provided a powerful, free-market analysis that identified four areas of improvement: ""excess savings,"" ""reduction opportunities,"" and ""disruption"" ? a measure that gives the agency free access to insurance companies' best practices.

The institute said the biggest losers and the most hurt would be low-wage workers.<|endoftext|>(Photo: Chip",machine
"Have Americans Warmed to Calls to ?Defund the Police?? ?Over the past three years in five states and the District of Columbia, police have militarized their uniforms to call to call for backup on the battlefield.

According to USA Today, officer Michael B. Bure, who defended the squad from charges of rioting, had said he didn't know if his officers had riot gear, but that he was doing it because he was being stopped by police.

""I've had officers tell me they think I'm a criminal, but it's totally fine to be told and when they told me I was being stopped I felt like that was criminal,"" said Bure, who is also a VCPD officer.

Bure went on to say that in states where police have visited their uniforms, they've ""tentatively"" offered to purchase a Taser ""for the stated reason of being stopped.""

Several other officers have said they will comply with the order given out by Black Lives Matter-related groups.

According to an account by the News & Observer of the incident, Black Lives Matter-related groups were willing to purchase a Taser for the stated reason of being stopped, but that they couldn't get a specific reason for the purchase.

Citing federal guidelines, as well as The Republic Report, police officers are allowed to go to any area of the force they wish without being stopped by law enforcement agencies.

On top of which, officers have the option of going to the nearest police station, and have not been told why and if the incident exists. The incident has also led to calls about the recent police shooting of an unarmed Black mother, and the recent police brutality of a teenager killed in Minnesota and in Florida by a police officer who shot his ex-girlfriend and wounded two other young women.<|endoftext|>One of my favourite parts of life is the long wait: The big problem with being ""on, off, off..."" is ""You must use your hands"". It is a way of hiding away pain and uncertainty to make life easier. For those who believe this is a false construct, this also means the actual human brain does not process what is happening. There are many reasons, and many reasons we are likely to understand. It is a complex process, and it is likely to create various difficulties. A key component of this complicated process is the use of memory, which leads to a lack of memory. This is very important to keep in mind, because, as a psychological condition, the brain does not always remember its own experiences the moment you are on. It is also very important to keep in mind that when the brain is still alive, it is always on again because we are remembering everything that previously happened. This way of forgetting the experience of the thought process and of remembering events the mind is free to move on without any sort of difficulty. Understanding the processes and emotions I've talked about above is a huge part of how research is going on in psychology. It is just another part of my life.

That part of my brain is the only one I think is important enough for us to recognize that there are multiple processes all related for thinking. One may go back to the first question about the cognitive process, the sense of remembering. My brain is not at all one of them. When learning it's not always easy to memorize, it is hard to use the memory to remember the experience and remember as much as possible, but it works. By doing this, you can create new experiences and experiences, and so on.

There are many reasons to think about being ""on, off, off..."" and ""Off"". It is a way of hiding away pain and uncertainty to make life easier.

For those who believe this is a false construct, this also means the actual human brain does not process what is happening to us when we are on and if we are ""off"" we have to rely on the information being the action of the mind with it. Our brains are also free to go to another part of our conscious brain which is the phenomenal memory. Every time you look at your memory, the human brain is in a state of state of mind of the present. People think they are asleep, they use a particular set of emotions, but have to learn to ignore them.

For those who see this type of memory being used in the same ways that it is used to make a conscious state, there should be no reliance on the phenomenal memory associated with all of our thoughts. One could think that this is not the case. We only go to another part of our conscious brain which is the one that takes conscious action, so we have to use all of our thoughts or emotions.

It is important that we remember these thoughts and understand them immediately. When we remember them, we will be more prepared for their interactions with us, and we will be less likely to use the memory to solve a long-term issue. Instead of doing an exercise, however, you should focus on what really makes you. The more that you can memorize",machine
"[Here?s what we know about the Jacob Blake shooting in Kenosha, Wisconsin.]The Justice Department has opened an investigation into the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis., as continued protests coincided with demonstrations in other cities, boycotts in several pro sports leagues, and a call from the vice president for ?law and order? from a national stage.As protesters poured onto the streets of Kenosha, Oakland and other cities, the authorities also gave new details in the shooting of Mr. Blake, a Black man who was partially paralyzed after a white officer, Rusten Sheskey, fired at him in front of his children on Sunday.Officials also announced the arrest of a 17-year-old from Illinois, saying he was charged with first-degree intentional homicide in a shooting that killed two men during protests in Kenosha on Tuesday night.With hundreds of Wisconsin National Guard troops deployed to Kenosha, President Trump on Wednesday said he also planned to send federal law enforcement officials, raising concerns that clashes could worsen between protesters and the authorities there.A spokeswoman for the Department of Justice said late Wednesday that the agency had deployed more than 200 federal agents and marshals and would ?continue to surge Kenosha with federal resources as needed and necessary.?The newest unrest, after a summer of protest, came as the federal authorities were already straining under a series of crises: a major hurricane in the Gulf, wildfires in the West, and the coronavirus pandemic nationwide.Hundreds of demonstrators marched peacefully late into the night in Kenosha, where many businesses? windows were boarded up on Wednesday after violence had erupted on previous nights. The National Guard was again sent into the city, which imposed a curfew that started at 7 p.m.The police briefly searched a truck that appeared to be carrying food and water for demonstrators, but there were no reports of clashes between law enforcement and protesters.The F.B.I. said on Wednesday that it would conduct the federal inquiry in cooperation with the Wisconsin authorities.This is the second such investigation for the Justice Department this year involving a white police officer and a Black man. In May, the department said it had opened an inquiry into Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer charged in the death of George Floyd during an arrest.Civil rights advocates, and even some lawyers inside the Justice Department?s Civil Rights Division, doubt the department will announce a decision or take action in either case before the presidential election, especially given that Mr. Trump has built his re-election campaign in part around his staunch support for law enforcement officers.Vice President Mike Pence, addressing the Republican National Convention on Wednesday, noted the strife gripping Kenosha, without mentioning what precipitated it: the latest shooting of a Black person by a white police officer.Mr. Pence was the only speaker of the evening to mention the Wisconsin city, where peaceful protests over the past several days have been accompanied at times by looting and fires.?The violence must stop, whether in Minneapolis, Portland or Kenosha,? the vice president said, citing other two other American cities where violence has also exploded amid protests. ?Too many heroes have died defending our freedom to see Americans strike each other down.?Mr. Pence, who in 2017 flew to Indianapolis for an N.F.L. game and then walked out after several players knelt during the national anthem, also sought to cast himself as a supporter of those who express their beliefs in nonviolent ways.Athletes from the N.B.A., W.N.B.A., Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer and the professional tennis tour took their boldest stand yet against police brutality, boycotting games on Wednesday in response to the police shooting of Jacob Blake.The moves dramatically escalated a season of athletes demonstrating for social justice, with some players expressing doubts about continuing to play during widespread social unrest.The boycotts came after Milwaukee Bucks players refused to come out of the locker room for their N.B.A. playoff game against the Orlando Magic. The league quickly postponed two other playoff games scheduled for Wednesday.Players in other leagues soon followed their lead, with numerous professional basketball, baseball and soccer games called off as a result. In the tennis world, matches at the Western & Southern Open, which is being played in New York, were suspended on Thursday, organizers said, with matches for men and women scheduled to resume on Friday.Naomi Osaka, a Japanese player who is Black, said on Wednesday night, before the announcement that the tournament had been suspended, that she would not play in the semifinals.?As a black woman I feel as though there are much more important matters at hand need immediate attention, rather than watching me play tennis,? she said in a statement wrote on Twitter.N.B.A. and W.N.B.A. players have long been at the forefront of protests in the sports world. But they went even further this year after the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and as leagues took an extended hiatus because of the coronavirus pandemic.LeBron James, the N.B.A.?s biggest superstar, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday: ?WE DEMAND CHANGE. SICK OF IT.?Since Mr. Blake was shot, many N.B.A. players had openly debated the wisdom of continuing to play, questioning whether the platform provided by the league?s return was amplifying their message or taking attention from the broader social justice movement.On Wednesday, more than three hours after Milwaukee?s game against Orlando had been scheduled to start, Milwaukee?s George Hill and Sterling Brown read a team statement.?We are calling for justice for Jacob Blake and demand the officers be held accountable,? Mr. Hill said. ?For this to occur, it?s imperative for the Wisconsin State Legislature to reconvene after months of inaction and take up meaningful measures to address issues of police accountability, brutality and criminal justice reform.?The Bucks? three main owners issued a statement expressing support for the team?s players, and players and coaches from the 13 teams still at Walt Disney World were invited to a meeting Wednesday night to determine what should happen next ? in essence to decide how soon, or even if, the playoffs should resume.On Thursday morning, former President Barack Obama praised the Bucks ?for standing up for what they believe in,? and commended the N.B.A. and W.N.B.A. ?for setting an example.??It?s going to take all our institutions to stand up for our values,? he said on Twitter.Asked by Politico about the unrest and boycotts on Thursday, Jared Kushner, President Trump?s son-in-law and senior adviser, said, ?I do think that peaceful protest has a place and it has importance.? But he added that he wanted to move to a discussion of ?constructive? solutions. ?This country has seen enough of the protests and some of the negative things that can happen,? he said, ?when the protests go too far or are hijacked by people who have a different agenda.?About players in the N.B.A., he said: ?They have the luxury of taking a night off from work. Most Americans don?t have the financial luxury to do that. I think it?s nice that they?re standing up for the issue, but I?d like to see them start moving into concrete solutions.?Wisconsin?s attorney general on Wednesday identified the white police officer who shot Jacob Blake multiple times in Kenosha, Wis., as Rusten Sheskey, a seven-year veteran of the city?s police force.Officers were responding to a domestic complaint on Sunday afternoon when they attempted to arrest Mr. Blake, state officials said. They used a Taser on Mr. Blake but it failed to stop him, and Officer Sheskey then fired his gun into Mr. Blake?s back.The attorney general, Josh Kaul, said that Officer Sheskey had fired his gun at Mr. Blake seven times. Mr. Kaul said that the officers who were involved in the confrontation, including Officer Sheskey, had been placed on administrative leave.Mr. Kaul also said on Wednesday that Mr. Blake had acknowledged having a knife ?in his possession? when the shooting occurred and that investigators had found a knife on the driver?s side floorboard of Mr. Blake?s car after the shooting.Ben Crump, a lawyer for Mr. Blake?s family, said in a statement that Mr. Blake had not posed any threat to police officers on Sunday, and denied that he was carrying a knife.?Based on our investigation on behalf of the Blake family, witnesses reported that Jacob had no knife in his hand,? Mr. Crump told CNN on Thursday morning. ?All Jacob Blake was trying to do was get in his car and get his three little boys away from a volatile situation. He did not pose a threat to law enforcement.?A 17-year-old from Illinois was arrested and charged on Wednesday after two people were fatally shot during a chaotic night of protests in Kenosha, Wis.The teenager, Kyle Rittenhouse, was arrested in Antioch, Ill., after being charged with first-degree intentional homicide, according to a court document filed in Lake County, Ill. Antioch is about 30 minutes southwest of Kenosha, just over the Illinois line.The deadly shooting erupted on Tuesday during the third night of unrest in Kenosha, as protesters scuffled with a group of men who were carrying guns and saying they wanted to protect Kenosha businesses from looting.A hail of gunfire broke out along a crowded, dark street, sending bystanders fleeing into parking lots, screaming. Two men, 26 and 36, were killed and a third was seriously injured.The authorities said Mr. Rittenhouse was not a protester but they did not say what he was doing there.The continuing strife in Kenosha prompted Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin to order hundreds of National Guard troops into the city. It also drew the attention President Trump, who has sought to portray jurisdictions run by Democrats as rife with danger and crime.Mr. Trump tweeted on Wednesday that he planned to deploy federal law enforcement officials to Kenosha and that Mr. Evers, a Democrat, had agreed to accept the help.Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old Illinois resident who walked among protesters in Kenosha, Wis., carrying a military-style semiautomatic rifle, was arrested and faces a charge of first-degree intentional homicide in a shooting that killed two people Tuesday night.Mr. Rittenhouse appeared on multiple videos taken during the night by protesters and bystanders who chronicled the events of the evening as peaceful protests gave way to chaos, with demonstrators, armed civilians and others facing off against one another and the police in the darkened streets.The New York Times?s Visual Investigations unit analyzed hours of footage to track Mr. Rittenhouse?s movements leading up to, and during, the shootings.Mr. Rittenhouse was arrested early Wednesday in his hometown, Antioch, Ill., about 30 minutes southwest of Kenosha and just over the state line.Multiple posts on his social media accounts proclaim support for pro-police causes like the Blue Lives Matter movement and Humanize the Badge, a nonprofit group that he ran a Facebook fund-raiser for on his 16th birthday.His posts also suggested a strong affinity for guns, with videos showing Mr. Rittenhouse taking backyard target practice, posing with guns and assembling an assault rifle.But many details about both his background and his motivations for walking around the Kenosha protests carrying an assault rifle are still emerging.Before the shootingsAbout two hours before the first shooting, the producer of a video livestream interviewed Mr. Rittenhouse at a Kenosha vehicle dealership.Mr. Rittenhouse was there at the same time as several other armed men. Some of them were positioned on the building?s roof overlooking the parking lot where vehicles were burned the day before.In a brief exchange on the livestream, he identifies himself as ?Kyle.?In another interview, Mr. Rittenhouse spoke with Richie McGinniss, a video editor at The Daily Caller, a conservative news and opinion site.Mr. Rittenhouse said that he was there to protect the business, calling it ?his job,? although there is no indication that he was asked to guard the site.Later, he claimed to another videographer that he was pepper sprayed by someone in a nearby crowd while protecting property.In most of the footage The Times has reviewed from before the shootings, Mr. Rittenhouse is around this area. He also offers medical assistance to protesters.About 15 minutes before the first shooting, police officers drive past Mr. Rittenhouse, and the other armed civilians who claim to be protecting the dealership, and offer water out of appreciation.As President Trump seized on the unrest in Kenosha, his opponent in the 2020 presidential election, Joseph R. Biden Jr., condemned what he called the ?needless violence? that has roiled the city during several days of protests.But Mr. Biden, the Democratic nominee, also expressed solidarity with peaceful protesters, denounced systemic racism and said he had spoken with the parents and other relatives of Mr. Blake, the Black man whose shooting by the police set off the protests in Kenosha.?I told them justice must and will be done,? Mr. Biden, speaking in a video that was posted on social media, said of his discussions with Mr. Blake?s family members. He also urged those listening to his remarks to ?put yourself in the shoes of every Black father and Black mother in this country and ask, ?Is this what we want America to be???Mr. Biden is confronting competing political pressures. While many Americans, including progressive Democrats, overwhelmingly support protests against racial injustice and police brutality, Mr. Trump has tried to cast his rival as a radical who would diminish or even eliminate police agencies, and unleash a wave of lawlessness.Mr. Biden, who opposes cutting funds to the police, was emphatic in criticizing those who were not protesting peacefully.?As I said after George Floyd?s murder, protesting brutality is a right and absolutely necessary,? he said. ?Burning down communities is not protest, it?s needless violence. Violence that endangers lives. Violence that guts businesses, and shutters businesses, that serve the community. That?s wrong.?Mr. Biden?s response to the events unfolding in Kenosha is his latest balancing act on law enforcement matters. His deep involvement in the 1994 crime bill, for example, has earned him skeptics among those who are focused on criminal justice reform.On the flip side, the Trump campaign has repeatedly, and falsely, accused Mr. Biden of seeking to defund the police. Despite being untrue, the claim could hurt him, especially in swing states like Wisconsin, if Republicans are able to make it stick.A Black man who was wanted in a homicide fatally shot himself as the police closed in on a downtown Minneapolis street on Wednesday afternoon, prompting a new round of protests and looting, the authorities said, three months after the killing of George Floyd in the city set off global demonstrations against police violence.Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota said the State Patrol was headed to the city to help restore order, and Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis said he had ordered an immediate curfew and had requested additional help from the National Guard.?What our city needs right now is healing,? Mr. Frey said at a news conference with the city police chief, Medaria Arradondo, on Wednesday night. ?We do not need more destruction. We do not need property damage that is unacceptable in every way, shape and form, and I want to be very clear: It will not be tolerated.?Later Wednesday evening, the police released video of the man shooting himself, saying it was important to quell rumors that he had been killed by the police.?People need to know the facts,? Chief Arradondo said, as he echoed the mayor?s demand that people leave the downtown.The new unrest came as protesters took to the streets elsewhere to condemn the shooting of Mr. Blake in Kenosha.Protesters in Portland, Ore., continued their nightly demonstrations that have lasted for three months, with Wednesday night?s march billed as being in solidarity with Kenosha.A crowd of about 200 marched to a federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement building, where federal officers came out to confront the crowd. Some protesters threw projectiles, and federal officers pursued them with tear gas and other crowd-control munitions. Local police officers later made a series of arrests on nearby streets.To the south, in Oakland, Calif., hundreds of protesters of protesters took to the streets in solidarity, with a march that began peacefully with a few hundred people calling for justice. Jacob Blake?s name was spray-painted on some boarded storefronts, and some protesters chanted the name of Oscar Grant, a 22-year-old Black man who was killed in the city in 2009.Later, some protesters set small fires in the streets, breaking windows and flipping trash cans. The police shared video footage showing a small fire inside the shattered glass doors of the Alameda County courthouse in Oakland.Photos showed smashed windows at a Whole Foods store, where a Black man had lost consciousness after being assaulted by a security guard in 2015 after an altercation about payment, and video footage also showed plumes of smoke rising near Lake Merritt after a car was set ablaze.Reporting was contributed by Katie Benner, Julie Bosman, Sarah Mervosh, Elian Peltier, Jacey Fortin, David Botti, Stella Cooper, Andrew Das, Sopan Deb, Annie Karni, Ellen Almer Durston, Reid J.

"'The left has gone off the deep end,' says Senator Rick Scott explains his position on police reform and his plan to fund the policeHouse Democrats on Thursday swiftly defeated a Republican resolution opposing so-called autonomous zones and the push to ?defund the police.?The resolution was brought to the floor by Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla. It called for justice for George Floyd,ÿwhose death in Minneapolis police custody last month touched off nationwide protests;ÿcondemned violence, rioting and looting;ÿand called for Congress to ?unequivocally oppose autonomous zones and efforts to defund the police.?REPUBLICANS RAMP UP ATTACKS OVER 'DEFUND THE POLICE' PUSHThe resolution stated the importance of law enforcement in America's communities, while noting that the job of law enforcement officials is ?inherently dangerous? and that officers ?put their lives on the line each day.?The measure also condemned officers who abuse their positions of authority and supported peaceful protests, while opposing ""autonomous zones"" -- like the one carved outÿof several city blocks in Seattle --ÿand efforts to defund the police.""What happened in Minneapolis we all know was a tragedy. Never should have happened. Wrong as wrong could be and his family deserves justice,? Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said on the House floor Thursday. ?There is a big difference between peaceful protest and rioting. There is a big difference between peaceful protests and violence. There is a big difference between peaceful protest and attacking police officers. And there is certainly a big difference between peaceful protest and forming CHAZ or CHOP or any type of autonomous zone.?Jordan added that the resolution ?strongly opposes what I think is one of the craziest public policy proposals I have ever seen: this idea that we're going to defund the police.""House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy?s office said Thursday that ?not a single Democrat voted in favor of this resolution.?Their refusal is downright shameful,? McCarthy?s office said.This comes as the House is slated to vote on and likely pass a Democrat-authored police reform package?the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2020?which would curb officer immunity from legal repercussions stemming from acts committed in the line of duty.JUSTICE IN POLICING ACT: WHAT'S IN THE DEMOCRATIC POLICE REFORM BILL?The Justice in Policing Act would also set up independent investigations at the state and local level and allow ?pattern and practice? investigations by state attorneys general and the Department of Justice. Currently, many police misconduct investigations are handled internally.The legislation would also create a national police misconduct registry, change use of force and other standards, make lynching a federal crime, and set best practice recommendations.A Republican-authored police reform bill was blocked by Democrats in the Senate on Wednesday.GOP efforts to publicly denounce the ?defund the police? push comes as the movement gained momentum in recent weeks.What defunding the police looks like is different in various localities.

"Over the past five years, as demands for reform have mounted in the aftermath of police violence in cities like Ferguson, Mo., Baltimore and now Minneapolis, police unions have emerged as one of the most significant roadblocks to change. The greater the political pressure for reform, the more defiant the unions often are in resisting it ? with few city officials, including liberal leaders, able to overcome their opposition.They aggressively protect the rights of members accused of misconduct, often in arbitration hearings that they have battled to keep behind closed doors. And they have also been remarkably effective at fending off broader change, using their political clout and influence to derail efforts to increase accountability.While rates of union membership have dropped by half nationally since the early 1980s, to 10 percent, higher membership rates among police unions give them resources they can spend on campaigns and litigation to block reform. A single New York City police union has spent more than $1 million on state and local races since 2014.In St. Louis, when Kim Gardner was elected the top prosecutor four years ago, she set out to rein in the city?s high rate of police violence. But after she proposed a unit within the prosecutor?s office that would independently investigate misconduct, she ran into the powerful local police union.The union pressured lawmakers to set aside the proposal, which many supported but then never brought to a vote. Around the same time, a lawyer for the union waged a legal fight to limit the ability of the prosecutor?s office to investigate police misconduct. The following year, a leader of the union said Ms. Gardner should be removed ?by force or by choice.?Politicians tempted to cross police unions have long feared being labeled soft on crime by the unions, or more serious consequences.When Steve Fletcher, a Minneapolis city councilman and frequent Police Department critic, sought to divert money away from hiring officers and toward a newly created office of violence prevention, he said, the police stopped responding as quickly to 911 calls placed by his constituents. ?It operates a little bit like a protection racket,? Mr. Fletcher said of the union.A spokesman for the Minneapolis Police Department said he was unable to comment.A few days after prosecutors in Minneapolis charged an officer with murder in the death of George Floyd, the president of the city?s police union denounced political leaders, accusing them of selling out his members and firing four officers without due process.?It is despicable behavior,? the union president, Lt. Bob Kroll, wrote in a letter to union members obtained by a local reporter. He also referred to protesters as a ?terrorist movement.?Mr. Kroll, who is himself the subject of at least 29 complaints, has also chided the Obama administration for its ?oppression of police,? and praised President Trump as someone who ?put the handcuffs on the criminals instead of us.?In other instances, unions have not resisted reforms outright, but have made them difficult to put in place. Federal intervention is often one of the few reliable ways of reforming police departments. But in Cleveland, the union helped slow the adoption of reforms mandated by a federal consent decree, according to Jonathan Smith, a former U.S. Justice Department official who oversaw the government?s investigation of policing practices there.Mr. Smith said union officials had signaled to rank-and-file officers that the changes should not be taken seriously, such as a requirement that they report and investigate instances in which they pointed a gun. ?I heard this in lots of departments,? Mr. Smith said. ??Wait it out. Do the minimum you have to do.?? He said he believed that the reforms have since taken hold.Steve Loomis, the Cleveland police union president at the time of the consent decree, said he and his colleagues saw some of the mandated rules as counterproductive.?Every time a kid points a gun, he has to do a use-of-force investigation,? Mr. Loomis said of his younger colleagues. ?Now guys aren?t pointing their guns when they should be pointing their guns.?Robert Bruno, a professor of labor relations at the University of Illinois, posited that many police officers see themselves as authority figures who equate compromise with weakness. Other experts said it was rational for police unions, which are often regarded with suspicion by others in the labor movement and see themselves as distinct from it, to protect their members so relentlessly.?A major role for police unions is basically as an insurance policy,? said Dale Belman, a labor relations professor at Michigan State University who has consulted for police unions. ?The feeling of a lot of officers is that it?s very easy to sacrifice them. Something goes wrong and boom.?This has only become more true in an era of ubiquitous cellphone cameras and social media. And the feeling of being under siege has only strengthened demands from union members that they be protected.In Baltimore, where the city and the Justice Department reached a consent decree in 2017 to overhaul police conduct, the union has described a police department in chaos, with severe staff shortages and low morale. Those who remain said they feel unsupported by their commanders.?They?re ready to throw police officers under the bus to appease the media and don?t support us even when our actions are appropriate,? said one officer surveyed in a report released last year by a group helping the department implement reforms.It remains to be seen how the unions will respond to reform initiatives by cities and states since Mr. Floyd?s death, including a new ban on chokeholds in Minneapolis. But in recent days, unions have continued to show solidarity with officers accused of abusive behavior.The president of a police union in Buffalo said the union stood ?100 percent? behind two officers who were suspended on Thursday after appearing to push an older man who fell and suffered head injuries. The union president said the officers ?were simply following orders.?All 57 officers on the Emergency Response Team, a special squad formed to respond to riots, had resigned from their posts on the team in support of the suspended officers, according to The Buffalo News.Unions can be so effective at defending their members that cops with a pattern of abuse can be left untouched, with fatal consequences. In Chicago, after the killing of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald by officer Jason Van Dyke, it emerged that Mr. Van Dyke had been the subject of multiple complaints already. But a ?code of silence? about misconduct was effectively ?baked into? the labor agreements between police unions and the city, according to a report conducted by task force.New York City?s police unions have been among the most vocal opponents of reforms in Albany, including calls to reform the state?s tight restrictions on the disciplinary records of officers. Amid growing momentum in recent days for making those records public, the city?s police unions joined statewide police groups on Friday in urging the Legislature to keep the law in place.?No rational policy discussion can take place against a backdrop of burning police vehicles and looted store fronts,? read a memo of opposition from the police groups.The city?s patrol officers? union, with roughly 24,000 active members, and another representing sergeants have been sharp critics of Mayor Bill de Blasio, who took office in 2014 riding a wave of discontent over stop-and-frisk policing.The mayor promised reform, but after the fatal shooting of two uniformed officers in Brooklyn by a man who invoked the police killing of Eric Garner, Mr. de Blasio faced an all-but-declared revolt by rank-and-file officers.The head of the patrol officers? union, Patrick J. Lynch, said at the time that the mayor had ?blood on the hands.? Many officers turned their backs on Mr. de Blasio at the slain officers? funerals. And, days later, many more engaged in what amounted to a de facto work slowdown. Arrests plummeted as did tickets for minor infractions.Mr. Lynch has stood by officers even when there is ample evidence of misconduct, defending the officers who killed Amadou Diallo in 1999 and another who, in 2008, shoved a bicyclist to the ground during a protest ride. The union provided lawyers for the officers involved in both cases.When liberal politicians do try to advance reform proposals, union officials have resorted to highly provocative rhetoric and hard-boiled campaign tactics to lash out at them. This past week, the head of the sergeants? union in New York posted a police report on Twitter revealing personal information about the daughter of Mr. de Blasio, who had been arrested during a protest.In St. Louis, the business manager of a local police union, Jeff Roorda, penned an unflattering poem about Ms. Gardner, the local prosecutor, in a union newsletter that read: ?You?re a disaster, Misses Kim/ Your heart is dark and vile/You?d rather charge a policeman/ Than all the murders you could file.? The union has also run social media ads against an alderwoman who has also advocated reform, Megan Green, referring to her as a ?Communist Cop-Hater? and superimposing her head on the body of Mao Zedong.Mr. Roorda declined to comment.At times, the strident leadership appears to beget still more strident leadership. In 2017, Chicago?s Fraternal Order of Police elected a new president who denounced a federal Justice Department investigation prompted by the shooting of Mr. McDonald as ?politically motivated? and pledged to fight the ?anti-police movement.? That president was ousted this year by a candidate who had derided the ensuing consent decree as ?nonsense? and criticized his predecessor for failing to stand up to City Hall.While statistics compiled by the group Campaign Zero show that police killings and shootings in Chicago have fallen following a set of reforms enacted after a federal investigation, advocates worry that the union will undermine them in contract negotiations. Police unions have traditionally used their bargaining agreements to create obstacles to disciplining officers. One paper by researchers at the University of Chicago found that incidents of violent misconduct in Florida sheriff?s offices increased by about 40 percent after deputies gained collective bargaining rights.?By continuing to elect people who stand for those values, it more deeply entrenches the break between the community and the police,? said Karen Sheley, director of the Police Practices Project for the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois. ?It makes it far more difficult for reform efforts to go forward.?As critics of the police get louder and more mainstream, union members have elected more aggressive leaders. In Minneapolis in 2015, Mr. Kroll defeated the union?s longtime president by a nearly two-to-one margin after the city installed a police chief intent on reform.?I believe Bob Kroll was elected out of fear,? said Jane‚ Harteau, the police chief at the time, adding that Mr. Kroll?s message to officers was: ?We are the only ones that support you. Your community doesn?t support you. Your police chief is trying to get you fired.?Mr. Kroll did not return a call seeking comment. John Elder, the Police Department spokesman, said the current police chief and Mr. Kroll have a strong relationship.Ms. Harteau said that the department introduced new rules requiring officers to protect the ?sanctity of life? and intervene if they saw a colleague improperly using force, but that the union under Mr. Kroll undermined the changes by protecting officers who violated the policies. Data on police shootings and killings in the city appear to show little change despite the reforms.?I struggle to know if they have gotten more extreme, or if the world has changed and they haven?t,? Mr. Fletcher, the city councilman, said of the union. ?Either way, they are profoundly misaligned with the moment.?",human

"Chris Wallace says president can't prove charge.Things would be so much easier for the Trump campaign if Joe Biden was in favor of defunding the police.But the president and his team are determined to tie every out-there left-wing position around their opponent?s neck, brushing aise his denials.This is not a novel political tactic. Both parties try to paint opposing nominees as extreme and warn of the horrible fate that will befall America if they become (or remain) president. Both parties try to caricature the other (Republicans will take away your health care and cater to the wealthy, Democrats will bankrupt the country and allow riots).DEFUND OR DISMANTLE THE POLICE? WHAT IT COULD MEANBut Biden is a fascinating case study. While he?s certainly more liberal than any past Democratic standard-bearer of the modern era, he?s largely avoided embracing the most controversial proposals from the Bernie/AOC wing of the party. Biden has said repeatedly he doesn?t support defunding the police, he didn?t back the Green New Deal and refused to support Medicare for All, drawing flak from the woke progressives.But President Trump took a very different tack in the Chris Wallace interview that aired Sunday.?Biden wants to defund the police,? Trump said.?No he, sir, he does not,? Wallace countered.?Look,? Trump said. ?He signed a charter with Bernie Sanders; I will get that one...Did you read the charter that he agreed to with...??It says nothing about defunding the police,? Wallace said.?Oh really? It says abolish, it says -- let?s go. Get me the charter, please.?An aide brought the document, and Wallace was right--it did not address taking money away from police departments.After the ?Fox News Sunday? interview aired, Trump tweeted: ?He may use different words, but that?s what he wants to do.?Now ?wants to do? is an interesting political standard: Wants to raise your taxes. Wants to take your guns away. But in politics you have to make the case. The president?s charge about the Bernie agreement was wrong, so he tried to say it?s part of Biden?s hidden agenda.The Trump campaign hits this hard in fundraising pitches, one of which is titled ?No More Police,? saying ?the Democrats have made it clear that they want to defund and abolish our police.? Another says, ?As Joe Biden and his Democrat colleagues continue to push their defund the police agenda, criminals across the country are seizing the opportunity to loot and tear down our monuments to America?s founders.?True, some Democrats have a defunding agenda, which is why the Trump people keep lumping them in with Biden.Now Biden did give the opposition an opening in a conversation with liberal activist Ady Barkan, who asked, ?But do we agree that we can redirect some of the funding???Yes, absolutely,? Biden replied.But what Biden said next was not included in a widely circulated video of the interview: ?And by the way, not just redirect--condition them.

"Trump pounding at defund the police, but Biden is an elusive target.

And when it comes to the military and other civilian law enforcement agencies and military officials, one reason is that the Pentagon is so far behind. The department had a ""full-scale budget"" to purchase a few billion dollars annually to train hundreds of police, sheriff's chiefs and other personnel in their policing-centred approach, for training and education on the use of force.

""It's no longer about the Army or the Air Force or the Army-centres like we used to have. They're like the Marine Corps or the Navy. They are different,"" Biden said. ""We're a service in the future. The Department of Defense is going to be a force we look forward to in this life. The Department of Defense is going to be a service in the future.""

Some people in the military aren't familiar with many police practices. The military, said a former Army sergeant, said it's not uncommon for a police force director to try to hire a cop to help him or a supervisor, take a call from an unidentified cop, and try to sell a gun to an officer or tell him how to drive his car or make a cash deposit. ""I don't have a lot of experience in the business,"" he explained.

Some police officers, like Joe Kincaid, who has been in the force for 16 years, are no fan of the military's ""justified"" culture.

""It's a very tough thing to hire and not have a police officer and a public service if you're going to hire in, to protect the public but you're going to be in a big fight over who you would hire if you're in a police position because your name is just like your name,"" he said. ""They're going to be hiring private persons to protect the life of the public while the taxpayer is sitting around with the money, if you're actually not a citizen who's in the military.""

That's where Gary Gutzman, president of the American Police Association, is coming down in his column.

""These are all the officers who were drafted into the armed services,"" Gutzman wrote, adding that he believes the Pentagon may be violating their ""basic oaths."" The Defense Department issued a statement calling the military ""totalitarian"" ? or as ""totalizing equality"" ? ""not a civil rights issue.""

Some critics dismiss the military, citing its ""constitutional rights"" clause, which says ""all men are equal"" and that the military should not be ""tearing the head to sand"" in the service of law enforcement:

It is a constitutional right that has been upheld in some courts and in Congress. It is a right which had been protected in the military for over a thousand years by the Constitution. It is a right which has never been violated by the military. ?President John F. Kennedy, U.S. Army, 1952-1963

""Let us never forget what did it happen to me. When I graduated the army in 1947, I was working for the Army of the Union for eight years. I was stationed at the New York City Airport, working there and I saw how hard the Americans were working. I also was stationed at the French Military for nearly a thousand years ? and they came in in 1940 and 1949. I saw how hard the Americans really were,"" he said.

The Defense Department did not say whether it knew about plans to send a special representative to Chicago, but there are two official military officials in Chicago who are part of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Gutzman, a retired general who heads the Chicago police union, said he has been told by a retired senior military officer that the Pentagon could do nothing to help him.

""I am concerned about this because they've been in the military for over a thousand years,"" he said. ""I know they're the top of my team and it's up to me to get rid of everything.""

Gutzman has been the subject of criticism in Congress in the past. On Monday, a House panel in charge of investigating the allegations of misconduct by the CIA and the Pentagon has attacked the military's conduct.

""The military has turned an extraordinarily complicated environment into an international pariah within America,"" said Rep. Adam Smith (Wash.), the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, a GOP Armed services committee.

But he isn't complaining. If a military officer is working for the U.S. government, he or she may never need to pay the fine.

Former and current senior military figures have said that while they have experienced the Army abuses, they haven't experienced that degree of discipline. The Air Force has acknowledged it didn't pay enough money to hire more civilian cops.

""I'm still a part of the military,"" said Lt. Col Todd Brezafer, a retired Army officer and former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""Ining has been a soldier for over a thousand",machine

"WASHINGTON ? Senate Democrats said on Tuesday that they would block Republicans? attempts to advance a narrow bill to encourage police departments to revise their practices, rejecting the measure as ?woefully inadequate? and setting up a clash that could mark the death of a fledgling congressional effort to address racial bias in law enforcement.Their decision, outlined the day before a planned test vote on the Republican bill, reflected deep opposition to the measure among Democrats and civil rights leaders, who have dismissed the legislation as an antiquated and inadequate response to systemic racism in policing amid a national outcry for an overhaul.It also reflected an election-year political bet by Democrats that they can gain more by blocking what they consider a fundamentally flawed measure ? and blaming Republicans for the demise of reform efforts ? than by trying to salvage it, which could provide cover for Republicans in the eyes of voters who increasingly regard the issue as urgent.?No bill will pass as a result of this ploy by Senator McConnell,? Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said on the Senate floor, referring to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. Mr. Schumer implored Republicans to negotiate a more expansive bill that both parties could support. ?The Republican majority has given the Senate a bad bill and proposed no credible way to sufficiently improve it,? he said.The Republican bill, spearheaded by Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the party?s lone African-American member in the chamber, is vastly different from the one congressional Democrats have proposed. The Democratic bill is expected to pass the House on Thursday; Mr. McConnell has said that package is ?going nowhere? in his chamber.Mr. Scott?s bill would provide incentives for state and local police departments to make changes, including limiting the use of chokeholds and penalizing departments that do not require the use of body cameras, but would not alter the qualified immunity doctrine that shields officers from lawsuits or place new federal restrictions on the use of lethal force.The House measure, the most expansive intervention into policing that lawmakers have proposed in recent memory, would change qualified immunity, raise the bar for the use of lethal force, make it easier to track and prosecute police misconduct, and aim to force departments to eliminate the use of chokeholds.If Senate Republicans fail on Wednesday to muster the 60 votes necessary to advance to debate on Mr. Scott?s bill ? as now seems all but certain ? it would be a major setback in efforts to enact an overhaul this year targeting excessive use of force and racial discrimination by law enforcement, as protesters across the nation continue to clamor for major changes. And it would be the latest in a litany of pressing issues that have paralyzed the Senate, where freewheeling debate, negotiation and compromise on legislation that can become law have become the exception rather than the rule.Republicans were furious on Tuesday at Democrats? refusal to advance the measure and accused them of deliberately creating a logjam for political purposes, rather than trying to find a way to enact meaningful change.?If your objective is to solve the issue of police reform and not campaign on the issue of police reform, the way you do that is by coming to the table and voting yes, so that we have an opportunity before the entire American public to understand what the differences are, iron them out and move it forward,? Mr. Scott told reporters. ?If this is more about campaign rhetoric and presidential elections, then they will not vote yes for this.?Mr. McConnell brushed away Democrats? complaints and insisted that the Senate would proceed with the vote on Wednesday as planned, arguing that they should at least try to modify the measure rather than rejecting it before even starting debate.?If they don?t feel like they?ve had fair treatment, their remedy is to refuse to finish the bill,? he said. ?There?s literally no harm done by debating this important topic.?But Democrats appeared to see plenty of risk in proceeding with a measure that falls well short of what their core supporters demand, and to be confident that voters would blame Republicans, not them, for the death of the policing overhaul effort. They have been making the case for nearly two years that the Senate has become a legislative graveyard for Democratic initiatives, an impression Mr. McConnell himself has often fed.In a letter on Tuesday to Mr. McConnell, Mr. Schumer, along with Senators Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey ? sponsors of the Democratic bill ? called the Republican measure ?so threadbare and lacking in substance that it does not even provide a proper baseline for negotiations.??We will not meet this moment by holding a floor vote on the Justice Act, nor can we simply amend this bill,? they wrote. ?This bill is not salvageable, and we need bipartisan talks to get to a constructive starting point.?They received additional cover after dozens of civil rights groups, including the N.A.A.C.P. and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights wrote to lawmakers urging them to block the legislation.?The question simply is: Who do you trust more on police reform in America?? Mr. Booker said. ?The N.A.A.C.P. or Mitch McConnell??The breakdown fueled frustration in both parties on Tuesday, with Republicans and Democrats bitterly pointing fingers at each other for the emerging stalemate, even as a frenzied round of hushed discussions unfolded in private to try to salvage the effort.In a tense back and forth on the floor, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, one of the drafters of the Republican bill, asked Ms. Harris how she could oppose legislation that included a bill she spearheaded that would make lynching a federal crime.?It?s like asking a mother: save one of your children and leave the others,? Ms. Harris replied.In private, Mr. Scott shocked his colleagues when he spoke at Republicans? weekly luncheon about death threats he and his aides had received in recent days, according to two officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door remarks. He played some aloud for his colleagues, all of whom are white.The calls, filled with profanity and racist slurs, included one diatribe addressed to ?Uncle Tim,? where the caller, after cruelly and profanely condemning Mr. Scott, his family and some of his Republican colleagues, told Mr. Scott to ?take your one-way ticket straight to hell.?One caller discussed putting the senator ?in his cross hairs,? Mr. Scott said.?It?s interesting that we are on the right side of the police reform conversation, yet we?re on the wrong side according to the people, based on the way that we are characterized in the national press,? Mr. Scott said in a brief interview, after playing two of the calls his office had received.While racist attacks and threats are not new to Mr. Scott or his office, he said they had become more aggressive in recent days.Both parties have reason to resist a compromise. Republicans in recent weeks have rushed to devise a response to the public outcry for change, putting forward significant policing legislation for the first time in years and beginning to speak in frank terms about racism in America, a topic they have often avoided. But they are unwilling to stray too far from President Trump ? who has emphasized ?law and order,? advocated tough police tactics and ignored the issue of racism in law enforcement ? and risk alienating their base with the kind of sweeping measures Democrats are demanding.Eyeing an increasingly favorable political environment, Democrats have little incentive to adopt a narrower overhaul, or open themselves to potentially difficult votes on law enforcement matters. The collapse of the Senate bill would allow them to skewer Republicans for failing to adequately respond to the crisis as they try to regain the Senate majority in the fall. And if their refusal to budge produces concessions by Republicans ? as was the case when they initially blocked two coronavirus relief packages they called insufficient ? they could still claim credit.?I do not intend to be a part of a discussion where some might suggest Democrats are trying to stand in the way of police reform,? Ms. Harris told reporters. ?In this case, sadly, it is the Democrats ? not with any of our Republican colleagues, at least so far ? that are doing the real work of engaging in what must be reform of the system.?Some lawmakers were holding out hope that closed-door conversations between Mr. Scott, Mr. Booker, Ms. Harris and others could yet yield a compromise. But leaving one such meeting on Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Scott voiced no such optimism.?If they won?t even start it,? he said of Democrats, ?that tells me that this is already over.?Emily Cochrane, Nicholas Fandos and Luke Broadwater contributed reporting.",human

Best is the city's first Black police chief and the pay cut would put her salary well below her White predecessor.The council's plan also removes officers from a team that dismantles homeless camps.?While we can?t do everything in this summer rebalancing package, we have set the path forward for tremendous work in front of us as a council and as a city,? Councilwoman Teresa Mosqueda said.The move to defund the city's Navigation Team, and redirect the money to homeless outreach services such as REACH will ?dramatically restrict the city?s ability to address unauthorized encampments,? Jason Johnson, Interim Director of Seattle?s Human Services Department, wrote in a letter to the council last week.Some council members have said the initial cuts are a first step to more sweeping reductions and a rethinking of law enforcement in Seattle.""It's important to show community members that we hear them, that we're working towards the same goal,"" Councilwoman Teresa Mosqueda said last week.Mayor Jenny Durkan and Best have urged the council to slow down its discussions about police budgets, saying the issue can be taken up in earnest when the 2021 city budget is considered. They also argued any layoffs would disproportionately target newer officers, often hired from minority communities, and would inevitably lead to lawsuits.SEATTLE COUNCIL MEMBERS UNVEIL PLAN TO LAY OFF COPS BUT BALK AT DEFUNDING DEPARTMENT BY 50 PERCENT RIGHT AWAYDurkan has already targeted about $20 million in savings from the police budget this year, largely because of spending pressure due to reduced revenues because of the COVID-19 pandemic.Last month, the mayor sketched out a plan to reduce the police budget by about $75 million next year by transferring parking enforcement officers, the 911 call center and other areas out of the department.As U.S. attorney in Seattle, Durkan previously pushed a Justice Department investigation that found officers too quick to use force, leading to a 2012 consent decree with the federal government. Reviews by an independent monitor have determined that the changes under the consent decree have led to a drop in how often police use force. But critics have said the department's actions during recent protests show not enough progress has been made.Reducing funding for police departments has been championedÿby protesters in Seattle and other cities around the country following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

"Over the past week, among the countless variations of protest signs carried by demonstrators across the country, one message has gained new traction: ?Defund the police.?On Sunday, it was a common theme in Los Angeles, where Mayor Eric Garcetti unveiled a proposal to divert $100 million to $150 million from the Police Department?s budget to programs that would benefit communities of color ? a response that many said didn?t go nearly far enough, while others said such a move would have been unimaginable just weeks ago.San Francisco?s mayor, London Breed, made a similar announcement, though without a specific dollar number attached.And San Jose?s mayor, Sam Liccardo, rejected calls to defund the city?s Police Department, instead saying he wanted to reform it.But what does it actually mean to defund a police department?My colleague Dionne Searcey tackled this question in more detail here, but on a very broad level, what it means is to stop spending so much public money on police departments ? where gear and pay are expensive ? and instead use that money on other things that activists say would better serve the community.That could include mental health resources, housing and education. With more funding for those services, activists say, more people would be cared for, and crime and violence would decrease.When I spoke with Marqueece Harris-Dawson, a Los Angeles City Council member, he mentioned the example of police officers escorting people experiencing homelessness onto buses to go to shelters, only because they were the only public workers able to do the job.?If all you?ve got in your toolbox is a hammer, you tend to think everything is a nail,? he said. ?And that disables society as a whole and ends up with death and injury, for particularly African-American young men, but also people of color in general.?[Read the full interview.]How is this different from reforming police departments?It is, in some ways, a matter of degree. Activists in Los Angeles have noted that the $150 million cut Mr. Garcetti proposed is just a fraction of the department?s more than $1.8 billion budget.In many places, however, activists aren?t just pushing to divert money away from police departments, they are calling to dismantle them entirely.That was the case in Minneapolis, where, over the weekend, a veto-proof majority of the City Council pledged to dismantle its Police Department and instead create a new system of public safety from the ground up.The new system could follow various models that have been established in cities around the country. In Eugene, Ore., a team called CAHOOTS ? Crisis Assistance Helping Out on the Streets ? deploys a medic and a crisis worker with mental health training to emergency calls.[Read more about how officials are exploring changes to policing around the country.]What are arguments against defunding or dismantling police departments?Those who don?t support defunding or dismantling police departments have mostly said they?d like to see reforms of existing systems instead.Democrats in Congress unveiled legislation that would make it easier to identify, track and prosecute police misconduct.Mayor Liccardo said in a statement that defunding San Jose?s Police Department would ?hurt the very people who have suffered the most from systemic racism.?He suggested that shrinking the department would lead to ?rich, white communities and businesses in suburban malls? hiring private security guards.In Los Angeles, LAist reported that the director of the L.A. Police Protective League, which represents L.A.P.D. officers, blasted Mr. Garcetti as ?unstable,? over his proposal to cut funding. Jamie McBride, the director, said cuts could lead to slower responses to 911 calls and would cause ?crime to go out of control.?Is this a partisan issue?No ? not neatly, in any case.That?s especially true in California, where one of the State Legislature?s highest profile battles last year was over legislation that enacted one of the nation?s toughest standards for the police use of force.The law that eventually passed represented a compromise between two bills ? one backed by the A.C.L.U. and families of police-shooting victims, and the other backed by police unions, Laurel Rosenhall of CalMatters reported.The debate highlighted divides even among Democrats over how to police the police, and underscored the power of police unions, which, as my colleagues reported, have continued to be outspoken defenders of officers accused of misconduct, even as rates of union membership have declined more broadly.[Read Dionne?s full piece here.]Amid everything going on, you may have lost track of the state?s reopening process.Although case counts continue to rise, particularly in Los Angeles County, dine-in restaurants, hair salons and casinos have already been allowed to reopen in much of the state, with precautions.And starting on Friday, most counties in the state will be allowed to reopen movie theaters, bars, zoos, gyms, hotels and campgrounds ? all with modifications you can read about here.And officials are urging anyone who?s been to a protest to get tested.[See when 511 epidemiologists say they?ll start doing everyday things again.]We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

"Police Groups Wield Strong Influence in Congress, Resisting the Strictest Reforms

By Ryan N. Wilson

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The goals of a proposed court challenge to the ban on Muslim businesses in the United States were met with resistance at the U.S. Supreme Court.

The State Department issued a brief Friday urging the high court to uphold federal civil rights protections against discrimination on the basis of religion.

The brief from four Republican judges criticized those actions by the U.S. government and its allies in Washington and followed a landmark decision on a lawsuit by the Texas Tribune Co, calling the practice ""a religious right-focused emergency travel ban.""

The judge in the case, Thomas B. Blanton, Jr., granted a preliminary injunction in an October 2013 lawsuit filed by the Muslim ""Factory Commission"" which was barred from citing or participating in such the list.

The case, filed in federal court in Washington, denies a key part of the application by Thomas Rovel in a similar case last year over an 18-week period which affected state and local government, employees of food stamp recipients and a small number of law enforcement agencies.

Blanton rejected the injunction in 2009, and in March a judge issued a stay that halted some federal lawsuits of the organization. The restaurant chain asked that the injunction be stayed pending further proceedings.

A federal judge in June also denied Blanton's brief to vacate the injunction, which only denied a change in state rules allowing for a law enforcement agency, the Black Hawk with guns, to provide health insurance to American employees. The order does not deny health coverage to Muslims, the judge said, or to the Houston Police Department.

Rovel's lawsuit had been the only federal civil rights suit brought against the State Department over ""Islamic Community Service Organizations.""

BLANT, USING THE VENUSATORY, OUT OF CROWN

Rovel, who built the restaurant chain, is now seeking a stay of its ""religious freedom"" case to keep its restaurants off the hate registry. The order would end the state government's request for an injunction.

The State Department is facing considerable pressure from congressional Democrats, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to uphold that order. The California Democrat introduced legislation in June to reverse the injunction.

Supporters of the ban said that businesses who do not comply would be subject to a civil penalty of up to $20,000 if they are barred from doing business. Those businesses are subject to the expense requirement for complying with the ban.

Homeland Security Investigations Inspector General Bruce Stratton said he wasn't aware of any reports of any such information about any state protection against civil rights violations and said any information should be released to members of Congress.

Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said they wanted to stay the ban until the Court can ""enforce the public's judgment.""

""I think the State Department needs to treat this as a unique example of an executive order with broad potential, particularly when not even issued this late in the evolution of recent history,"" Grassley said in a statement.

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, was appointed to the House Foreign Affairs Committee by President Barack Obama. The House panel is dominated by Democrats. The state attorney general has been a critic of the ban.

A federal judge issued a temporary stay in a long-running civil rights case against a group of service personnel for practicing Islamic prayer for 12 years. It seeks to prevent that organization from taking some form of religious exercise and providing religious training to employees.

Blanton's small group was in effect a ""true Muslim family business,"" but defying the state ban gave an agenda to follow in federal court to stop it.

Blanton, who has previously issued communications letters to Barack Obama to remove the name of one of the detained officers, who says he has family ties to the Fort Hood shooter, said he hoped to challenge the temporary injunction.

Outside the media and jail sites, reporters also kept an eye on the security personnel and waited anxiously for news coverage of the ruling.

"Police Departments Are Parasites on the Public Purse

By CITIN, MANDATORY.com

According to data analyzed by the U.S. Geological Survey, there are more than 24 million registered ""unidirectional"" admissions of a vaccine in the United States, a 23 percent increase over 2007.

The number of unidirectional admissions increased for the first time on February 1, 2016. More than 23 million people received unidirectional admission over the previous year.

Since 2002, the number of unidirectional admissions to the US has increased from approximately 18,800 to 30,300 (in 1995) ? 30 percent increase in admissions to the US is the second highest in US years.

The CDC and federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that more than 50 percent of the people who have been exposed to a vaccine were infected by the same types of disease in 2009.

The new report, entitled ""The Health, Medical & Cultural Services of U.S. Health and Human Services,"" will be published on February 7, 2016 at the conclusion of CDC's annual State of the Nation report: The US public health system was underfunded by the federal government in order to ensure public health services like vaccines were effectively eliminated, and that public health services like vaccines were still a viable provider of public health services in the United States.

Based on a comprehensive, nationwide database of 1,921,796 individuals who have passed through the National Health and Medical Expenditures Survey (DHS2010) since 2001, the National Health Service estimates that the U.S. public health system is responsible for an increase in unidirectional admissions of vaccination-related diseases, such as cancer, Alzheimer's, cardiovascular problems, HIV, and epilepsy/AIDS.

According to the CDC's Division of Hospital Nutrition, Unidirectional admission: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and all the federal governments are responsible for an increase of one-third and an-third of a percent of the admissions of public health services, such as health insurance coverage, mental health, home care and vaccines.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the number of unidirectional admissions to the public health system increased by 1,097,000 in 2008. At the national and state level, more than 5.32 million, or 41% of all unidirectional admissions were from people who had no health insurance, making them the highest-risk populations in the United States.

The National Multiple Health Program of Federal Funding to Reduce Unidirectional Health Discharges (NEJM2012) was the fourth largest federal funding channel of funds for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). NEJM2012 is the foundation for funding for single-payer health insurance systems, such as Medicare and HON, to prevent infectious diseases, reduce the burden of infectious disease and prevent disease from moving onto the mainstream.

The CDC's research team determined that the prevalence of infectious diseases in US is a significant proportion of those that may occur in the United States, and the rise in unidirectional admissions in US also was among the most concerning. The data is based on the national databases covering 1648 people over the past decade and show that the prevalence rose by 1.3% per year for 10 years starting in 1991 and 7.9%. These results should be reflected in the CDC's estimates of the total number of unidirectional admissions for the US.

The CDC estimates that non-medical diseases which require avoidance medications in hospitals or medical centers include infections, tuberculosis, chronic diseases, and multiple sclerosis.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that people of diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds and family background have an annual incidence of 1.9 million infections (in addition to the 3.4 million reported in this survey). In addition, these infections and infections cause a large part of more illness, or less disease, in the United States in the first quarter of 2013, compared with the first quarter of 2011.

The estimated number of infections to healthcare providers per person is higher for less than one-in-10 adults. For individuals with more than 20 infections, CDC estimates are about one in 40 who have a healthy digestive system that is less healthy than a person without a serious illness ? and about one in three that are healthy.

While the CDC estimates that approximately 20% of the total population has no health or dental health insurance, the prevalence rates of unidirectional and infectious diseases represent large numbers of patients for whom the disease is prevalent.

These are among the most common symptoms of unidirectional disease in the United States. The prevalence of unidirectional disease is rising more dramatically than those of healthy individuals, such as children, or people with diabetes. In 2013, health care providers of all national and state healthcare services provided an estimated 4.2 million more unidirectional than",machine
"In recent weeks, as protests erupted in Minneapolis and around the country over the police killing of George Floyd, Minnesota lawmakers promised quick action: they?d make it easier to fire abusive officers, raise the standard for using deadly force, give the attorney general (rather than local district attorneys) the authority to charge and prosecute abusive cops, ban choke holds and ?warrior-style? training, and fund community-based violence intervention programs. These measures wouldn?t defund or dismantle the police. They were quite modest, given the breadth of protests and radical demands emanating from the movement. Still, on the morning of June 20, the Minnesota Legislature ended its special session without passing a single police bill.In a moment of deep pain and anguish, with hundreds of thousands of people taking to the streets to press for an end to state violence ? risking their safety from police reprisal and coronavirus ? how can lawmakers turn their backs on this uprising?The answer for many is police unions. But the problem isn?t just the police or other law enforcement unions. Scholarship on criminal justice policymaking in the United States finds that a multisided law enforcement lobby, made up of prison guard unions, district attorney associations, sheriffs? associations, police chief organizations, and, yes, police unions, wields inordinate power. In our research on California, Florida, Texas, and other states, we?ve chronicled how the lobby has blocked efforts to change sentencing laws, abolish solitary confinement, outlaw capital punishment, close prisons and jails, end commercial bail, and on and on. Legislators tell us outright: major reform legislation has little chance of passing unless law enforcement is on board (or gets out of the way).To reimagine policing and end mass incarceration, or even achieve meaningful reforms, we must reckon with the political power law enforcement interest groups have accrued.The law enforcement lobby grew in size and clout beginning in the 1970s, as states and the federal government poured money into policing, prosecution, and punishment. In the 1990s, with politicians competing to be seen as the toughest on crime (especially crime associated with black and brown people), law enforcement groups ? and the retributive crime victim?s organizations they supported ? became kingmakers. Every politician wanted men and women in uniform behind them. In return, law enforcement organizations learned to reward political friends with endorsements and financial contributions and punish enemies through negative campaigning and accusations about being soft on crime.Today, the law enforcement lobby has power in numbers. Organizations pool resources, delegate tasks, and present a unified front. In California, a formidable coalition has been instrumental in passing and protecting ultra-punitive sentencing laws. In New York, law enforcement organizations spearheaded a successful campaign to gut bail reforms passed last year. By joining forces, these groups overwhelm political adversaries, typically civil liberties and community groups with less money and fewer connections.Sometimes, the power of law enforcement organizations is easy to see. The groups run ads and publicly pronounce that reforms will lead to crime, death, and anarchy. After New York State passed major bail reform legislation in 2019, the New York City police union declared, ?Our elected leaders are putting kids in harm?s way by making child porn a bail-free crime.? Not only will this lobby use public shaming against its political opponents, but also against colleagues who won?t fall in line. Police unions and allied politicians have harassed, protested, and tried to oust progressive prosecutors, especially black women, who are committed to racial justice and reducing mass incarceration.At other times, the lobby?s influence sometimes takes less obvious forms. The organizations work behind closed doors, using their unique access to ostensibly educate lawmakers about the issues. Positioning themselves as the only legitimate experts on crime control, they reinforce the belief that intensive policing, harsh sentencing laws, and incarceration are imperative to protect public safety. As a result, politicians torpedo, water down, or defer reform measures.During the Minnesota Legislature?s special session, law enforcement successfully advocated delaying action ? a common tactic that allows time for public pressure to subside and lobby pressure to intensify.So is the law enforcement lobby too powerful to dislodge? Recent developments suggest not.The pressure to break law enforcement?s choke hold on criminal justice policy is growing. Even Minneapolis police chief Medaria Arradando said on 60 Minutes last month that leaders of his city?s police union ?are going to have to come to a reckoning that either they are going to be on the right side of history .?.?. or, they will be left behind.?A combination of activists, journalists, and organized labor have portrayed cop unions as self-interested organizations that block meaningful reforms and protect officers that brutalize people. If pressure continues to build, more public officials may be emboldened to acknowledge and limit police unions? power through legislation and contract negotiations. If the narrative sticks, it also could make law enforcement endorsements less valuable, decreasing the incentive for legislators to act on the organizations? behalf.Rising voices are demanding lawmakers reject, return, or donate contributions from police and prison officer unions. Reform-minded district attorneys in California have asked the American Bar Association to ban police unions from contributing to prosecutorial campaigns, specifically to avoid conflicts of interest. Citizens United is a roadblock to barring spending on campaigns because it allows law enforcement unions, like corporations, to spend unlimited amounts on independent expenditures. But efforts to stigmatize law enforcement contributions could achieve similar ends if electoral candidates come to believe, to quote a New York activist, ?taking police money implies that you?re actively OK with cops murdering black men or torturing people in jails.?There are fewer direct efforts to limit the prosecutor association?s political power; reformers have instead focused on electing progressive district attorneys. They have seen some success, with renegade DAs beginning to assert independence, breaching the idea that all prosecutors share the same views. If more progressive DAs win office, there?s hope they?ll form their own associations to serve as a political counterweight to their tough-on-crime colleagues.The barriers to a dramatic shift of power are formidable. Yet we?ve seen that disruptive politics can rapidly change the political playing field, forcing politicians to listen to people from heavily policed and imprisoned communities. By refusing to cooperate ? taking over streets, threatening property, and disrupting commerce ? Black Lives Matter and local activist groups like Minneapolis?s Black Visions Collective have challenged the legitimacy of the police, swayed public opinion, and forced policymakers to consider changes once seen as impossible.With protesters still in the streets, a handful of cities have acted boldly, cutting police budgets, removing police from schools, and ending violent tactics like no-knock warrants and choke holds. Colorado recently passed a major legislative package that includes ending qualified immunity, which has shielded cops from civil liability for violating people?s constitutional rights.Minneapolis seemed poised to go further when a veto-proof majority of the City Council publicly committed to dismantling the police. But the council then announced it would begin a year-long process of engaging ?with every willing community member in Minneapolis.? Law enforcement groups and their allies, we suspect, will use the long pause to frighten voters, lobby city officials, and resist major changes. As politicians hold hearings, experts conduct studies, and public pressure decreases, law enforcement moves the conversation from systemic transformation to watered-down reform.Now that huge majorities of people in Minneapolis and elsewhere express support for Black Lives Matter and criminal justice reform, it?s critical to keep up the pressure. Policymakers need to understand that they can?t turn their backs on this uprising, and that adjourning without action is shameful ? even riskier than taking on the law enforcement lobby.",human
"WASHINGTON ? Former President Barack Obama threw his support behind the efforts of peaceful protesters demanding police reforms during his first on-camera remarks since a wave of protests over the killing of George Floyd convulsed the country and upended the 2020 election.Mr. Obama, offering a strikingly more upbeat assessment of the protesters than President Trump and White House officials, said he believed only a ?tiny? percentage had acted violently.?For those who have been talking about protest, just remember that this country was founded on protest ? it is called the American Revolution,? Mr. Obama said from his home in Washington. He made the comments during an online round-table event with his former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. and activists from Minneapolis sponsored by My Brother?s Keeper Alliance, a nonprofit group Mr. Obama founded.?Every step of progress in this country, every expansion of freedom, every expression of our deepest ideals have been won through efforts that made the status quo uncomfortable,? said Mr. Obama, who adopted a conciliatory tone that contrasted sharply with Mr. Trump?s tweets and public remarks. ?And we should all be thankful for folks who are willing, in a peaceful, disciplined way, to be out there making a difference.?Mr. Obama called on every mayor in the United States to review use-of-force policies and to aggressively pursue an eight-point slate of police reforms that include mandatory de-escalation of conflicts, a ban on shooting at moving vehicles, timely reporting of violent incidents, and prohibitions on some forms of restraint used by the police.?Chokeholds and strangleholds, that?s not what we do,? Mr. Obama said as he sat, tieless in blue shirt sleeves, in front of a bookcase. He said officials in New York City and Chicago had already agreed to adopt the measures. Other localities, including Atlanta, quickly followed suit.Mr. Obama also said that the ?vast majority? of police officers, in his view, were not violent, and predicted many would ultimately support reforms despite the opposition of some unions.Reflecting on the larger meaning of the protests, Mr. Obama said the unrest after Mr. Floyd?s death was ?unlike anything I have seen in my lifetime? and expressed hope that Americans would be ?reawakened? to unite around racial justice. ?In a lot of ways, what has happened in the last several weeks is that challenges and structural problems here in the United States have been thrown into high relief,? he said. ?They are the outcome of not just an immediate moment in time, but as the result of a long host of things ? slavery, Jim Crow, redlining and institutional racism.?With the exception of his support for protesters, Mr. Obama confined his remarks to the issues of policing and racial disparities in health care during the coronavirus pandemic that have led to higher rates of infection and death in nonwhite communities.Mr. Obama, as he often does, tried to avoid a one-on-one battle with his successor, a fight he thinks will energize the president?s conservative base and overshadow his friend Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democrats? presumptive nominee. Mr. Obama did not directly address Mr. Trump?s bellicose comments or the president?s demand that the authorities ?dominate? protesters, although people close to the former president said he was outraged by the use of chemical spray on protesters before Mr. Trump walked to a fire-damaged church near the White House and brandished a Bible.Instead, Mr. Obama expressed optimism that the reform effort could transcend political divisions. He said that he was heartened by polls showing broad support for their grievances, and that this made the current situation more heartening than the protests in the late 1960s.Mr. Obama?s remarks tracked closely with two essays he posted online over the last week in which he implored young protesters to channel their rage into political action by turning out for Mr. Biden in November and to embrace local reforms to hold police officers accountable for abuses of power.?We should be fighting to make sure that we have a president, a Congress, a U.S. Justice Department, and a federal judiciary that actually recognize the ongoing, corrosive role that racism plays in our society and want to do something about it,? he wrote in a post on Medium on Monday.In recent appearances, Mr. Obama has become more forceful in his criticism of the White House, hammering Mr. Trump?s actions without invoking his successor?s name. Mr. Obama rebuked the current administration?s response to the coronavirus pandemic as ?chaotic? and questioned Mr. Trump?s commitment to the ?rule of law? in a call with former members of his White House team last month.For all his outward calm, Mr. Obama?s passions are running high, and the former president is finding it harder to stay on script, friends said. Over the last few days, he has been working the phones with close associates, including Mr. Holder, and strategizing about the best way to address the issues without inflaming the crisis.On Tuesday, a Minneapolis radio station reported that Secret Service officials were making preliminary preparations for a high-level visitor, perhaps Mr. Obama. But people close to the former president said he had no intention of traveling there this week ? although they did not rule out Mr. Obama?s participation in related events in the future.Shortly before Mr. Obama spoke on Wednesday, former President Jimmy Carter issued a statement calling for peaceful protest and systemic change. ?As a white male of the South, I know all too well the impact of segregation and injustice to African-Americans,? the 95-year-old former president wrote. ?We need a government as good as its people, and we are better than this.?Those comments came a day after another former president also presented an alternative vision of the protests to Mr. Trump. In a lengthy statement, former President George W. Bush expressed solidarity with the demonstrators in the streets and, without naming the incumbent president, warned against trying to suppress the protests.?It is a strength when protesters, protected by responsible law enforcement, march for a better future,? Mr. Bush said on Tuesday. ?This tragedy ? in a long series of similar tragedies ? raises a long overdue question: How do we end systemic racism in our society? The only way to see ourselves in a true light is to listen to the voices of so many who are hurting and grieving.?Mr. Bush, the only living Republican former president ? and one who refused to vote for Mr. Trump in 2016 ? made no direct reference to the current president. But Mr. Bush spoke after Mr. Trump?s photo op havoc, and the former president?s comments read like a rebuke.?Those who set out to silence those voices,? Mr. Bush said, ?do not understand the meaning of America ? or how it becomes a better place.?Mr. Obama struck a similar tone Wednesday, saying the overall message of the protests was simple, admirable and unifying: ?See me, I?m human,? he said.Peter Baker contributed reporting.",human

Paxton said in a statement. ?Unfortunately, the targets of this ?canceling? are the brave men and women who selflessly put their lives on the line to keep our families safe.""The city has struggled to control crime, violence and homelessness, and the mayor and council disregarded the safety of the capital, the people who live there and the guests who visit, Paxton said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPActivists who have been calling for the police to be defunded weren?t happy with the final agreement either. Communities of Color United, an Austin activist group, was calling for a 50% divestment, which amounts to $220 million. They also said a majority of the funds are an accounting shift that will allow the police to still access them in the near-term.Fox Business' Paul Best contributed to this report.ÿ",human
"SEATTLE ? Faizel Khan was being told by the news media and his own mayor that the protests in his hometown were peaceful, with ?a block party atmosphere.?But that was not what he saw through the windows of his Seattle coffee shop. He saw encampments overtaking the sidewalks. He saw roving bands of masked protesters smashing windows and looting.Young white men wielding guns would harangue customers as well as Mr. Khan, a gay man of Middle Eastern descent who moved here from Texas so he could more comfortably be out. To get into his coffee shop, he sometimes had to seek the permission of self-appointed armed guards to cross a border they had erected.?They barricaded us all in here,? Mr. Khan said. ?And they were sitting in lawn chairs with guns.?For 23 days in June, about six blocks in the city?s Capitol Hill neighborhood were claimed by left-wing demonstrators and declared police-free. Protesters hailed it as liberation ? from police oppression, from white supremacy ? and a catalyst for a national movement.In the wake of the killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police, the Black Lives Matter movement is calling to defund the police, arguing that the criminal justice system is inherently racist.Leaders in many progressive cities are listening. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced a plan to shift $1 billion out of the police budget. The Minneapolis City Council is pitching a major reduction, and the Seattle City Council is pushing for a 50 percent cut to Police Department funding. (The mayor said that plan goes too far.)Some even call for ?abolishing the police? altogether and closing down precincts, which is what happened in Seattle.That has left small-business owners as lonely voices in progressive areas, arguing that police officers are necessary and that cities cannot function without a robust public safety presence. In Minneapolis, Seattle and Portland, Ore., many of those business owners consider themselves progressive, and in interviews they express support for the Black Lives Matter movement. But they also worry that their businesses, already debilitated by the coronavirus pandemic, will struggle to survive if police departments and city governments cannot protect them.On Capitol Hill, business crashed as the Seattle police refused to respond to calls to the area. Officers did not retake the region until July 1, after four shootings, including two fatal ones.Now a group of local businesses owners ? including a locksmith, the owner of a tattoo parlor, a mechanic, the owners of a Mexican restaurant and Mr. Khan ? is suing the city. The lawsuit claims that ?Seattle?s unprecedented decision to abandon and close off an entire city neighborhood, leaving it unchecked by the police, unserved by fire and emergency health services, and inaccessible to the public? resulted in enormous property damage and lost revenue.The Seattle lawsuit ? and interviews with shop owners in cities like Portland and Minneapolis ? underscores a key question: Can businesses still rely on local governments, which are now rethinking the role of the police, to keep them safe? The issue is especially tense in Seattle, where the city government not only permitted the establishment of a police-free zone, but provided infrastructure like concrete barriers and portable toilets to sustain it.The economic losses that businesses suffered during the recent tumult are significant: One community relief fund in Minneapolis, where early protests included vandalism and arson, has raised $9 million for businesses along the Lake Street corridor, a largely Latino and East African business district. ?We asked the small businesses what they needed to cover the damage that insurance wasn?t paying, and the gap was around $200 million,? said Allison Sharkey, the executive director of the Lake Street Council, which is organizing the fund. Her own office, between a crafts market and a Native American support center, was burned down in the protests.Some small businesses have resorted to posting GoFundMe pleas for donations online.Many are nervous about speaking out lest they lend ammunition to a conservative critique of the Black Lives Matter movement. In Portland, Elizabeth Snow McDougall, the owner of Stevens-Ness legal printers, emphasized her support for the cause before describing the damage done to her business.?One window broken, then another, then another, then another. Garbage to clean off the sidewalk in front of the store every morning. Urine to wash out of our doorway alcove. Graffiti to remove,? Ms. McDougall wrote in an email. ?Costs to board up and later we?ll have costs to repair.?The impact of the occupation on Cafe Argento, Mr. Khan?s coffee shop on Capitol Hill, has been devastating. Very few people braved the barricades set up by the armed occupiers to come in for his coffee and breakfast sandwiches. Cars coming to pick up food orders would turn around. At two points, he and his workers felt scared and called 911. ?They said they would not come into CHOP,? said Mr. Khan, referring to one of the names that protesters gave to the occupied Capitol Hill area. ?It was lawless.?He had to start chipping in for private security, a hard thing to do when his business had already been hurt by the coronavirus.But he considers himself lucky ? and he was. Even weeks after the protests, blocks of his previously bustling neighborhood remained boarded up and covered in shattered glass. Many business owners are scared to speak out, Mr. Khan said, because of worries that they would be targeted further.One mid-July morning in the neighborhood, workers in orange vests were mopping off the sidewalks and power-spraying graffiti off the sides of buildings. Two window repair guys said they had their hands full for weeks. Shattered street lamps were being unscrewed and replaced.A confusing array of security teams wandered around, armed with handguns and rifles. Some wore official-looking private security uniforms. Others wore casual clothes and lanyards identifying their affiliation with Black Lives Matter. A third group wore all black with no identifying labels and declined to name their group affiliation.When a tall man in a trench coat and hiking boots walked over to question Mr. Khan, the man spread his coat open, revealing several pistols on harnesses around his chest and waist. He presented a badge on a lanyard that read ?Black Lives Matter Community Patrol.?His name is Rick Hearns and he identified himself as a longtime security guard and mover who is now a Black Lives Matter community guard, in charge of several others. Local merchants pay for his protection, he said as he handed out his business card. (Mr. Khan said he and his neighbors are now paying thousands of dollars a month for protection from Iconic Global, a Washington State-based private security contractor.)Mr. Hearns has had bad experiences with the police in his own life. He says he wants police reform, but he was appalled by the violent tactics and rhetoric he witnessed during the occupation.He blamed the destruction and looting on ?opportunists,? but also said that much of the damage on Capitol Hill came from a distinct contingent of violent, armed white activists. ?It?s antifa,? he said. ?They don?t want to see the progress we?ve made. They want chaos.?Many of the business owners on Capitol Hill agreed: Much of the violence they saw and the intimidation of their patrons came from a group these business owners identified as antifa, which they distinguished from the Black Lives Matter movement. ?The idea of taking up the Black movement and turning it into a white occupation, it?s white privilege in its finest definition,? Mr. Khan said. ?And that?s what they did.?Antifa, which stands for anti-fascist, is a radical, leaderless leftist political movement that uses armed, violent protest as a method to create what supporters say is a more just and equitable country. They have a strong presence in the Pacific Northwest, including the current protests in Portland.When the occupation in Seattle started in early June, Mayor Jenny Durkan seemed almost amused. ?We could have the Summer of Love,? she said.After President Trump took aim at the governor of Washington State and Seattle?s mayor on June 11, Ms. Durkan defended the occupation on Twitter as ?a peaceful expression of our community?s collective grief and their desire to build a better world,? she wrote, pointing to the ?food trucks, spaghetti potlucks, teach-ins, and movies.?The lawsuit by the small-business owners, filed by the firm Calfo Eakes on June 24, seizes on such language, pointing out that the city knew what was happening and provided material support for the occupation.Matthew Ploszaj, a Capitol Hill resident, is one of the complainants. He said his apartment building, blocks from Mr. Khan?s shop, was broken into four times during the occupation. The Seattle Police were called each time and never came to his apartment, according to Mr. Ploszaj. When he and another resident called the police after one burglary, they told him to meet them outside the occupation zone, about eight blocks away. He and other residents spent nights at a friend?s house outside the area during the height of the protests.The employees of Bergman?s Lock and Key say they were followed by demonstrators with baseball bats. Cure Cocktail, a local bar and charcuterie, said its workers were asked by protesters to pledge loyalty to the movement: ?Are you for the CHOP or are you for the police?? they were asked, according to the lawsuit.The business owners also found that trying to get help from the Seattle Police, who declined to comment for this article, made them targets of activists.Across from Cafe Argento is a funky old auto repair shop called Car Tender run by John McDermott, a big soft-spoken man. On June 14, Mr. McDermott was driving his wife home from their anniversary dinner when he received a call from a neighbor who saw someone trying to break into his shop.Mr. McDermott and his 27-year-old son, Mason, raced over. A man who was inside the shop, Mr. McDermott said, had emptied the cash drawer and was in the midst of setting the building on fire. Mr. McDermott said he and his son wrestled the man down and planned to hold him until the police arrived. But officers never showed up. A group of several hundred protesters did, according to Mr. McDermott, breaking down the chain-link fence around his shop and claiming that Mr. McDermott had kidnapped the man.?They started coming across the fence ? you see all these beautiful kids, a mob but kids ? and they have guns and are pointing them at you and telling you they?re going to kill you,? Mr. McDermott said. ?Telling me I?m the K.K.K. I?m not the K.K.K.?The demonstrators were livestreaming the confrontation. Mr. McDermott?s wife watched, frantically calling anyone she could think of to go help him.Later, Mr. McDermott?s photo and shop address appeared on a website called Cop Blaster, whose stated aim is to track police brutality but also has galleries of what it calls ?Snitches? and ?Cop Callers.? The McDermotts were categorized as both of those things on the website, which warned they should ?keep their mouths shut.?Many of the listings include names and addresses of people who are said to have called the police. Since the Cop Blaster post went up, Mr. McDermott?s shop has received so many harassing phone calls and messages that some employees have had to take time off.A block away is Bill Donner, the owner of Richmark Label, who let police officers use the roof of his factory to monitor the demonstration. Inside, his company had spent 50 years making labels for products like whiskey, soaps and natural beef jerky. Many days during the occupation, Mr. Donner, who said he was in favor of police reform, had to negotiate with the occupiers of the zone for access to his factory.Twice, he called 911 and was told that the police would not be coming into the area.The experience of the small-business owners seems a universe away from the rhetoric of Seattle?s politicians. As the violence turned deadly, Councilwoman Kshama Sawant, who represents Capitol Hill, defended the protesters? use of their own armed guards instead of the police.?Elected committees of self defense have historically played vital roles during general strikes, occupations and in mass movements, in order for the working class and marginalized people to defend themselves and carry out necessary functions in place of the forces of the state,? she wrote. She has called for the local police precinct to be permanently placed under ?community control.?When the mayor did send in police officers to end the occupation after the shootings, Ms. Sawant wrote on Twitter, ?Shame on Mayor Jenny Durkan for deploying Seattle police yesterday in a brutal attack against peaceful Black Lives Matter protesters & homeless neighbors at the Capitol Hill Organized Protest.?Many protesters who remained in early July were milling around a small tent encampment on a lawn at Seattle Central College, some with rifles slung over their shoulders. The smell of weed drifted through. The streets were full of moving trucks.The crowds were gone, but every now and then, the demonstrators gave speeches about the importance of disbanding the police. Sometimes the activists spoke about what went wrong with the occupation. One young woman on a bullhorn argued to passers-by that the police left too quickly and that a sustainable police-free region would have to be built more slowly.These days, storefronts in the neighborhood remain boarded up, covered in Black Lives Matter signs and graffiti. Demonstrators still hold evening protests, albeit smaller and quieter than before. But the businesses remain on edge.?This is an ongoing crisis,? Mr. Donner said on Tuesday. ?Protesters are apparently staying until they get some of what they want. No one knows what level of city cooperation will be enough for them.?But the area is slowly going back to its old normal. The park and playing fields have been cleared, and police officers have returned to the streets. An apartment building that opened earlier this summer is finally attracting prospective tenants.A spokeswoman for Mayor Durkan did not comment on the lawsuit but acknowledged frustrations from small businesses.?Many who live and work in Capitol Hill and other parts of the city continue to witness daily protests that are rightly demanding an end to systemic racism,? she wrote. ?In some circumstances, businesses and residents have faced property destruction in the last two months.?She encouraged the businesses to file claims.",human
"Biden and Trump trade barbs over protests; Peter Doocy reports.Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden voiced his support for law enforcementÿas much of his party is torn over a push to ""defund the police"" during a local news interview after his speech in Pittsburgh on Monday.""Let's get the facts straight, I not only don't want to defund the police.ÿIÿwant to add $300 millionÿto their local budgets to deal withÿcommunity policing toÿget police and communities back together again,"" Biden told KDKA.SEATTLE CITY COUNCIL APPROVES PLAN TO DEFUND POLICE DEPARTMENT, SLASHES JOBS AND SALARIES""The only person defunding the policeÿis the president,"" he continued. ""Look at his budget.ÿHe calls for a half a billion dollar cut in local law enforcement.

      In June, whenÿ""defund the police"" becameÿa rallying cry for many of the protesters demanding justice forÿGeorge Floyd, Bidenÿcalled for police reform but said he did not support defunding police departments.Biden said he wantsÿreforms including more funding for public schools,ÿsummer programsÿand mental health and substance abuse treatment, includingÿa $300 million investment inÿthe Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS).EXCLUSIVE: DHS CHIEF DRAWS LINE IN THE SAND AS PORTLAND MAYOR REJECTS HELP DESPITE ONGOING RIOTSBiden has previously saidÿthat President Trump wants to cut funding for local law enforcement by roughly $500 billion, a claim that PolitiFact has rated as ""Mostly True."" Trump's FY 2021 budget proposal would reduceÿJustice Department funding for state and local law enforcement by $380 million compared to FY 2020, and the president's budget would also cut COPS by $170 million, according to PolitiFact.

      Biden said he supported conditional funding for police departments in a July videoÿinterview with NowThis conducted by progressive activist Ady Barkan.""If they don't eliminate chokeholds, they don't get Byrne grants;ÿif they don't do the following, they don't get any help,"" he said.ÿ""If they don't do, because you know as well as I do, the vast majority of allÿpoliceÿdepartments are funded by the locality, funded by the municipality, funded by the state. It's only the federal government comes in on top of that, and so it says you want help, you have to do the following reforms, you have to make sure you have no-knock warrants eliminated, if you have them, you don't get Byrne grants.""Byrne grants through the Justice Department are the ""leading source of federal justice funding to state and local jurisdictions,"" according to the program's webpage.That video interview resurfaced this week whenÿRep.ÿSteve Scalise, R-La.,ÿremoved an edited video of Biden and Barkanÿhe posted on Twitter after backlash that the clip wasÿ""doctored""ÿto portray the Democratic presidential nominee as supporting the defunding ofÿpolice.Biden answered, ""yes, absolutely"" to a question from Barkan about whether ""we can redirect some of the funding"" to police during an early July interview. That exchange has been held up as proof by the Trump campaign and Republicans that Biden does want to defund police ?ÿthey equate redirecting funding from police departments, presumably decreasing the police budgets, with defunding police.A short clip of the interview posted by Scalise edited Barkan's voice to add the words ""for police"" to the end of Barkan's question asking Biden whether ""we can direct some of the funding,"" despite the fact that Barkan did not say ""for police"" at the end of the question. The context of the original exchange made clear that Barkan was talking about redirecting police funding, but the edit drew strong criticism nevertheless.""That's not the same as getting rid of or defunding all theÿpolice,"" Biden told Barkan in July. ""You cannot send my daughter, who has her master's degree in social work, she is one who engages in dealing with all those problems.ÿ... When you get a call to a third-story walk-up in a domestic dispute, you can't send a social worker, because a social worker may get shot too. So what happens you, what do you do, you can send along a social worker with aÿpoliceÿofficer.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPConservatives have continually called out Biden for saying he supports redirecting funding while dodging being associated with the ""defund the police"" crowd.""That's Washington speak for defunding,"" White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told ""The Story"" last week.ÿ""You know, you can't really allocate from one bucket without taking from that bucket to put in a different bucket.""Fox News' Tyler Olson contributed to this report.",human
