"Thomas H. Mungeer, president of the New York State Troopers Police Benevolent Association, weighs in on ?Fox and Friends Weekend.?Joe Biden's campaign came out Monday againstÿthe growing push to ""defund the police,"" saying instead that the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee supports the ?urgent need for reform.??As his criminal justice proposal made clear months ago, Vice President Biden does not believe that police should be defunded,? Biden campaign Rapid Response Director Andrew Bates said in a statement Monday. ?He hears and shares the deep grief and frustration of those calling out for change, and is driven to ensure that justice is done and that we put a stop to this terrible pain.?'DEFUND THE POLICE' WRESTS SUPPORT FROM POLITICIANS COAST-TO-COASTBates added that Biden supports ?the urgent need for reform,? which he said includes ?funding for public schools, summer programs, and mental health and substance abuse treatment separate from funding for policing ? so that officers can focus on the job of policing.?The Biden campaign pointed toward the former vice president?s criminal justice plan, which proposes an additional $300 million for community policing.ÿBates said that the funding would ?improve relationships between officers and residents? and would ?provide the training that is needed to avert tragic, unjustifiable deaths.??This funding would also go towardÿdiversifying police departments so that they resemble the communities in which they serve,? Bates added, noting that there is need for ?additional funding for body-worn cameras.?The campaign?s statement came as a push by activists to defund, dismantle or otherwise overhaul police departments was gaining momentum in major cities -- most notablyÿMinneapolis, where George Floyd's death while in police custody touched off nationwide protests and calls for policy changes in law enforcement.But it has also put pressure on prominent Democrats like Biden to speak out on the radical calls to abolish police.ÿThe statement opposing this came minutes after the Trump campaign held a call with reporters slamming the presumptive Democratic nominee for not, at that point, condemning the push.Trump campaign Communications Director Tim Murtaugh accused Biden of being ?weak? and ?unable to stand up to the most extreme elements in his party.??Joe Biden is attempting to pander and appease the far left of the party,? Murtaugh said Monday. ?He doesn?t have the strength to stand up to the extremists in his party.?He later saidÿthe Biden campaign's statement didn't go far enough.ÿ""Joe Biden cannot be let off the hook after his campaign issued a weak statement from a mid-level staffer.ÿ We still haven?t heard from Joe Biden himself on the radical ?Defund the Police? movement in the Democrat Party.ÿ It would have been the simplest thing in the world to stick his name on a statement, but he didn?t even do that,"" Murtaugh said in a statement.GOP RAMPS UP ATTACKS OVER EFFORTS TO DEFUND THE POLICE: 'DEMOCRATS ARE INSANE'ÿMeanwhile, the Biden campaign?s pointed to the former vice president?s criminal justice plan, which would ?reinvigorate community-oriented policing.?In a stunning development,ÿMinneapolis? left-leaningÿCity Council members on Sundayÿannounced a veto-proof push to disband theÿMinneapolis police, even as the mayor made clear he does not support abolishing the department.What defunding the police looks like is different in various localities. In Minneapolis, theÿsupermajority of the City Council seemingly supports a complete structural dismantling of the department. In other places, departments would remain in place but get fewer government resources, with some of their funding directed toward social justice programs.President Trump on Monday issued a broad condemnation of the ""defund"" push.""LAW & ORDER, NOT DEFUND AND ABOLISH THE POLICE. The Radical Left Democrats have gone Crazy!"" he tweeted.",human
"?Defund the Police? is a ridiculous movement, so say 64 percent of Americans. Yet, it is scary that a good third of our population, led by the more radical wing of the Democratic Party (including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Rep.ÿIlhanÿOmar, D-Minn.), thinks it is a palatable goal.Democratic leadership, terrified that this lunacy could alienate the suburban moms they are counting on this November, have defensively postured that it?s really not a call to end police funding, but merely one to transfer a good chunk of our street protection funds over to noble social programs that will presumably eradicate crime and lift the destitute out of poverty.But wait a minute. Haven?t we tried this all before? It was called the War on Poverty.GIANNO CALDWELL: JUSTICE ACTÿ? GOOD START ON POLICE REFORM BUT THIS ONE CHANGE NEEDEDLiberals in the 1960s and ?70s attacked law enforcement and allowed criminals to control our streets and prey on innocent residents and shop owners. The $22 trillion ?invested? in social programs would not only lift the poor out of poverty, they predicted, but it would eliminate the very need for police.How did that work out?CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTERThe era between 1969 and1980 was among the most crime-ridden of any in U.S. history. Meanwhile, the economy suffered due to massive inflation and limited opportunity.Program after expensive program was tried, and failed. The poverty rate at the end of the experiment was almost as high as it was when the well-meaning feel-good programs were initiated. Yet crime skyrocketed, leading to a flight of the taxpaying middle class to the safer suburbs. Why would we want to repeat that fiasco?Billions invested in pre-k programs were supposed to give low-income, especially minority, children an opportunity to close the education gap between whites and blacks. Yet, a study by research psychologist David Elkind showed that by the third grade, any potential gains garnered from the program washed out.The $1.2 billion invested in the federal 21st Century Community Learning (After School) Program in the 1990s ?didn?t affect student outcomes,? according to the Brookings Institute.A McKinsey Institute study concedes that despite $300 billion spent annually by the feds on job training, these programs ?don?t work.?It added, ?Most training and workforce programs don?t achieve what they set out to. The World Bank estimates that only 30 percent of youth employment programs are successful ? and many of those have limited positive effect.?Data shows that it?s a job and a strong economyÿ?ÿthe type we experienced in the last few years prior to the pandemic ?ÿthat does more to lift poor minorities out of poverty than does any government program.More recently, New York City?s socialist mayor, Bill de Blasio, wasted somewhere around a billion dollars on contracted mental health programs run by his wife, with analysts still trying to figure out what theÿnonprofitÿprogram was doing, let alone what it achieved. Meanwhile, his $700 million Renewal school program was shuttered due to unsuccessful outcomes.Over the past 30 years, states have increased spending on education by 375 percent in an effort to raise test scores and mitigate disparate racial outcomes. Yet, test scores remained relatively flat.So what does work?1. Maintaining a strong economyÿData shows that it?s a job and a strong economyÿ?ÿthe type we experienced in the last few years prior to the pandemic ?ÿthat does more to lift poor minorities out of poverty than does any government program. By 2019, there were 1.4 million fewer poor people than in 2017.Peter Cove, the author of ""Poor No More,"" was a one-time liberal social worker and adviser to President Bill Clinton. Over time, Cove realized that massive spending on social programs was succeeding only in making the poor more dependent on government.The prelude to Cove?s book says, ?In the 1960s, America set out to end poverty. Policymakers put forth an unprecedented package of legislation, funding poverty programs and empowering the poor through ineffectual employment-related education and training. However, these handouts produced little change, and efforts to provide education and job-training proved inconsequential, boasting only a 2.8 percent decrease in the poverty rate since 1965. Decades after the War on Poverty began, many of its programs failed. Only one thing really worked to help end povertyÿ?ÿand that was work...?Clinton?s workfare reforms did far more to reduce poverty than did placing people on government assistance. By 2001, the average monthly number of TANF recipients was 56 percent lower than the AFDC caseload in 1996.2.ÿStrengthening the family unitÿÿThe proportion of black children under 18 living in poverty decreases from 45 percent for mother-only households to just 12 percent for married-couple households.Out of wedlock births in the African-American community hover near 70 percent. Changing laws that incentivize parents living apart would be a far more effective policy than yet more well-meaning social programs.3.ÿCharter schoolsÿÿStudies in three states have demonstrated that attending charter high schools boosts college entry and persistence, while others link charters to decreased criminal activity.4.ÿReducing crimeÿViolent crime was cut by more than half from 1990 to 2015.But after cops started pulling back in 2015 due to public pressure following the Michael Brown killing in Ferguson Mo., by the next year, homicide rates in cities with populations of 1 million or more people increased by 20 percent.The victims were predominantly African-Americans.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY STEVE LEVYThe economic expansion for all races in New York City correlated to the dramatic reduction in violent crime ushered in by the Mayor RudyÿGuilianiÿadministration.

A message from a woman who used to live in this area. The address is 501 E. 5th St. in San Francisco; she is currently facing criminal battery in connection with the vandalism near the White House: www.thema.org/

It's not clear, though, if this is just an anti-climactic political attack from a group that has spent years and millions supporting human rights, civil liberties and other civil liberties while fighting for them.

A message from a man who lives in a community where they have almost 30,000 members who live outside of town, with a police camera parked outside the White House: http://www.thedailybeast.com/pages/news/local-government/18/27/

On the day of the police terror response, the photo speaks in a way, and a way, no less.

From this, this Twitter comment from a White House resident calling the police ""the enemy of the people,"" a woman, who uses the hashtag #StopBlackLivesMatter, asks the White House reporter what it is like to confront police who often harass people, and if the government should not investigate it (the answer is yes, but the White House reporter has a point).

To make it clear that this is not a protest, or it is merely a celebration, I will quote from a post I read:

The White House has a very sad and vile past, and yet the administration of Barack Obama has so firmly resisted the push to remove them ? an organization that does not believe this is a necessary way to fulfill American human rights ? for as long as they take back control of America, they will kill and incarcerate their very own people ... They are simply a way to be free of any kind of crime... They are not living in the best democracy they have had, nor are they likely to be in the worst of circumstances, and yet this is exactly what the Obama administration has done to those same people.

It's also true that the President has refused to grant him a pardon, not taking away the President's right to use the phone of his family and friends as a bargaining chip for the release of his people.

It's also true that the Administration has continued to refuse to even consider any action on this issue.

And the Obama Administration isn't merely ""unfair to the protesters"": it's literally blocking a legal proceeding to have the arrest of the White House.

It is also clear that in this climate, when the President has said that it was his opinion, the President has no role in this matter. He hasn't asked this particular request to simply take the step and agree to the action that can be taken, but he has been a consistent voice against these demands for as many times as possible.

There's plenty to be concerned about, but I can't speak for everybody: ""If Obama has not sought an explicit agreement to support or an immediate cease-fire with the People, he should not be president, but could do the same when the President has expressed his willingness to take the actions to support and fight these demands"".

We are still struggling with this administration's inaction, and I will say that my only regret is that no one even seems to know how to act. I am relieved that it is the White House.

It is my only regret is that this Administration has not tried to put the lives of law enforcement officers on the line to protect our nation's most vulnerable.

The ACLU is taking this issue seriously, including the Black Lives Matter movement. We are also concerned that the White House has acted in the best interest of Black Lives Matter ? and that a President can't just take the blame for inaction when it comes to the use of force in the United States.

I'm grateful that the Justice Department will not be held responsible for its inaction. I fully understand that justice requires the consent of all Americans everywhere and it is important that we ensure justice for ourselves, our loved ones and our children.

I hope this discussion can be made to be a constructive conversation about the safety and well-being of the American people in the face of a President who's simply acting to defend our nation and protect our children and grandchildren.

"McConnell blasts 'defund the police' movement as 'outlandish' amid George Floyd anger meeting

Updated

Prime Minister John Key says cyber attacks over police surveillance have caused a ""grave, ongoing, grave"" problem with online surveillance.

Key said there was ""no reason"" to believe a cyber attack on an election website could have occurred without the assistance of the National Security Agency and National Security Agency.

The electronic data routes were ""incredibly difficult to predict"" and occurred ""without proper precautions for cyber users"".

""There is a great deal of confusion, and it is crucial to understand why this occurs and why alternative methods for obtaining information are potentially useful,"" Key said.

""Today cyber attacks are intensifying against social media sites and mobile telecommunications companies in Australia.

""This issue has triggered a lot of discussions about cyber-enabled identifiers ? social media platforms that people use to communicate, such as LinkedIn ? that are vulnerable to cyber attack.""

Key said the Government had initiated the review into the Cyber-security Act in early June but that was delayed until after the review.

It will then examine the nature and extent of cyber threats and recommend specific improvements be made.

The review is to be handed over to the Federal Government next month.

Mr Key said the inquiry would look at how the National Security Agency and its British counterpart, the National Crime Agency, dealt with phone-hacking, email hacking, identity theft and online adverts.

He said they were entitled to do that and sought any evidence of criminality beyond defence and hacking.

But it said the Serious Fraud Investigation that had been set up had still not been completed and hacking was potentially illegal without the help of top-tier security-racking engineers.

The Government is releasing details of its Cybercrime and Identity Theft operation, including the number of devices used to steal identity information.

Opposition critic Warren Entrait called the report an ""unredeemed attempt to damage the integrity of the internet"".

In a speech to the internet radio station Download, Key said online services had increased costs by as much as $1 billion over the last five years in the wake of the online-advertising scandal.

The Office of National Statistics said the cyber threats posed by an average of over 1.4 million tweets a day had ""not just breached traditional boundaries of security"", but had also had ""real-time"" and ""lethal"" consequences.

'Almost incomprehensible'

In his press conference, Mr Key also pledged the Government would seek to improve measures across the digital platform, including the ability to block fake websites - whether businesses or social media platforms - from posting what he described as ""offensive"" information on sites such as Facebook.

Image caption Government had described the Cyber-crime operation as the ""most troubling threat"" previously discovered

Mr Key said the Cyber-crime operation was ""almost incomprehensible"" and ""inaccurate"" - making it a ""common misunderstanding"" on social media networks.

He said the Serious Fraud Investigation Team, working alongside the Australian Federal Police, would make further inquiries into the breach. The probe would be led for six months.

""I would be very distressed to hear that cyber attacks targeting organisations or organisations have increased many times before this happened,"" Mr Key said.

""A cyber attack in response to a genuine problem of an enterprise or a government data center is a cyber incident.

""It is not a matter of if. It is a matter of if, but -- if it is a crime and it is a crime.""

Mr Key said he was reluctant to ""rethink"" of his comments.

""It's not,"" he said.

He said he was surprised Mr Key had gone so far.<|endoftext|>In 2009, I had begun to write the first chapter on the game in detail and had enjoyed its initial release in 2010. The release of the first game saw the release in only one year, an iOS release that came with a limited theatrical release, a second Early Access game that was released only in Japan in the first-month of the game's life, and the arrival of the first Early Access. But there was little doubt that the development team for the second game had spent the whole offseason working to make it more successful and to improve them, and to make them more effective. The project was set to open in 2009 without a single major feature of a current game released in the US, and when I had published the second one in early 2010, I was devastated. All I could do was say, ""No, we can't build one"". I was determined to go and find a game that had always been successful, and I had finally found a way, right away.

"?At 5:10, there will be a teach-in on rent strikes and tenant organizing at the library tent,? announces an occupier to the crowd of people talking, playing chess, reading books, and grabbing Gatorades and early dinner in the middle of the occupation outside City Hall. It?s Sunday evening, June 28, and we?re in lower Manhattan ? the City Hall subway station in the middle of the encampment is closed, the entrance draped in ?Abolish the Police? banners, DEFUND NYPD graffiti chalked onto the gate.The occupier announcing the teach-in walks further through the encampment, toward a couple playing guitar and violin next to a chalked memorial of people killed by the New York Police Department (NYPD). Akai Gurley, his likeness sketched wearing a baseball cap, is beside Eric Garner. Shantel Davis is below Garner, and Ramarley Graham is beside Davis. ?Rest in Power NYC,? reads the sidewalk memorial. A bouquet of white roses rests on the ground next to the memorial; a few prayer candles sit among the portraits.The occupation at City Hall has one very specific demand: cut the NYPD budget by $1 billion and reallocate that money. The current budget for the NYPD is around $6 billion, making this a moderate demand, albeit one that many city councilors and the mayor oppose. (The demand among some groups at the occupation is to push for a greater cut, up to 50 percent.)?People need to understand that we?re meeting the city council where they?re at by demanding $1 billion,? says Nelini Stamp, a member of the collective of black activists that launched the occupation. ?But the long-term goal is abolition and black liberation, the long-term goal is to destroy capitalism, patriarchy, and white supremacy.??This is how policy works,? says Brandon West, another member of the organizing collective.By day, Stamp is the director of strategy for the Working Families Party. Several of the collective?s members hold day jobs at nonprofits or unions ? the originator of the encampment works for VOCAL-NY ? and distinguished their activity in the occupation from that work.Asked why the collective decided to launch an occupation, organizers spoke of the demobilization they felt was happening after weeks of mass marches sparked by the murder of forty-two-year-old George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.?We wanted to find a way to escalate,? says West. ?The idea was to create this space as an organic place for organizing and mobilization.?Judging by the time I spent there, they?ve succeeded. There were simultaneous teach-ins taking place throughout the park. When an anti?police brutality march arrived at the park at 6 p.m., occupiers stood up and cheered, greeting it with chants of ?No justice, no peace? and ?Black lives matter.? I spotted a familiar face from Occupy Wall Street, talking with what looked to be younger activists in a corner of the occupation.What remains unclear is if the city council will be pressured to reallocate the $1 billion when they take up the city?s budget today. Mayor Bill de Blasio has proposed cutting a much lesser amount from the police budget ? including an illusory reallocation of some of the budget toward the public schools in the guise of safety officers, i.e., police ? but organizers emphasize that this is insufficient.?It?s surprising to me that someone who could be such a proud surrogate of Senator Sanders now can?t do what needs to be done,? says Bianca Cunningham, another member of the organizing collective and of the Afrosocialists and Socialists of Color Caucus of Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). Of city councilors who won?t accede to the demand, Cunningham is direct: ?They?re playing politics over the safety and lives of people.??We have a lot of electeds, including black electeds, who are saying one thing and doing another,? says West.?Some black city council members have said that anyone pressuring black members are gentrifiers. And as someone born and raised in this city ? blood in, blood out, this is my city ? it?s really offensive to hear that?s what the focus is on,? says Stamp.As we talk, Stamp eyes the police, gathering across the street from the courthouse steps where we sit. There were reports of marchers getting pepper sprayed an hour or two earlier, and some occupiers are on edge. But as fellow occupiers pass on the sidewalk, ?see you tomorrows? and ?stay safes? are exchanged, and the optimism of the occupation peeks through despite a darkening sky. (After I leave the park, a biblical downpour drenches Manhattan. Later, I see videos of occupiers, decked out in raincoats, dancing in the rain.)?This is step one,? says Stamp. ?We need a win.?",human

In the wake of Der Sturm, Poland on February 25st, Tadej Smirnov talked about the ""outrage"" of Trump's statements in terms of Muslim citizenship. Despite that rhetoric, the president did not explicitly include women in his vow of protectionism. ""That's why this country will keep Donald Trump's words,"" Smirnov said.

But for all the previous symbolic upsets and blockades of Trump's own campaign and those of the People's Revolutionaries, the most relevant political-reaction narrative of 2016, most signified what it means for the Cold War's long term prospects for peace and political change. And to that end, post-American cold war, domestic terrorism this late in the year, rather than Beijing's victory over Moscow, also guaranteed that future regional and regional tensions would be avoided.

This development was also the story of Trump and two different figures before him: Merkel and John Kerry. That final struggle of the Cold War, with its disparate, militarized states, about to invade Ukraine in 2015 was galvanized by the election of the new authoritarian leader, Viktor Yanukovych, in a country that had the most communist constitution in Europe?but the bloc could no longer afford a break from Russia (while remaining totally in the corner). In fact, the political breakup and the coup attempt that followed attracted Europe's foreign policy establishment to declare that the agenda needed to be laid for a diplomatic peace.

Russia and the Soviet Union had created an unstable foundation that further constricted NATO. The postwar geopolitical situation?a looming domestic political crisis that only worsened relations between NATO's member countries and their region?left Europe unprepared for the Cold War?era threats from Russia. Between 1940 and 1974, the U.S. Eastern European states of Moldova and Bulgaria had faced the threat of imperial Russia. The new Russian authoritarian regime in Kiev put a severe form of structural integration under a sort of shadowy rubric?the cost was prohibitive in terms of several benefits.

Which meant that, throughout the post-Communist era, U.S.-Western relations and U.S.-Russian security ties may have been tinged by moral constancy and nationalism. There were signs that U.S. allies were beginning to consider reconsidering their initial aid?which included trade. In 1963, at the beginning of the Cold War, Turkey and China had accused the Soviet Union of continuing its support for Nazi Germany. A further factor, likely connected to Eastern Europe, was about to arrive. In the year 1794, the country saw a police operation in Kiev to intimidate Russian demonstrators on the Russian-Ukrainian border. Security intervention with just one officer was launched in response to the assault and the local media named it as a war crime. The U.S. response?first and foremost to change the Ukrainian constitution, then to expand NATO?were promising. The counterinsurgency campaign, under the banner of Russian aggression, lasted until 1871.

Without the same toll of social and economic disruption that occurred during the 1871 eruption of Mideast hostilities, including the crushing of the Dutch colonies during the 1875 rebellion by French settlers, it is unlikely that this story will tell its bloody tell in 2017?to be honest.

""At a time when other countries are planning to move in or out with a Russian-led military interventionist system,"" the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is quoted as saying.

As if the new monetary policies that have been enacted to try to support the economy and prevent Russia from becoming isolated about the pact, European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Junker said the restrictions could lead to a deeper recession.

""There's no doubt that we have bigger problems here. More and more... the ability to raise interest rates is what I call the tipping point because we have a very low rate of inflation at the moment,"" he said.

He added: ""Of course, I am going to ask the Fed to raise interest rates.""

But if Russia did drop interest rates, the Fed would also be taking steps to force down rates, Junker said. ""China has been developing it since 2015, but it's still going to be quite strong for us to get back into recession,"" Junker added.

He said that the actions of the Fed have done little to relieve fears that the tightening lending on offer to the EU economy may also be the demise of the overall US dollar.

""It's in the past too,"" he said, saying that Europe is using a move like quantitative easing, or QE, that would increase interest rates.

A banker attending the Reuters summit said the dollar was not holding a heavy all-time high, but a symbol of the world's ""great central bank"".

Merkils said on Friday that, in general, US markets had gradually started to pay more attention to the European Central Bank's response to concerns about the economy. ""That has to be weighed on the decision of the European Central Bank to go into the second round of QE, let alone the second-round in July or August. I was not surprised at the response of this bank,"" she said.

A new study conducted by CBS News has found that there may be more negative outcomes for the show than there were positive ones, according to CBS News.

Sneaks and Discovery both have an average of $1,865 in negative outcomes for Trek.

Here's a deeper look at some key findings:

1) Discovery didn't take advantage of the positive outcomes that viewers saw.

In the show's second season, Discovery created a new ship after the crew of ""Sneaks"" arrived at the Discovery on the last day of filming. Discovery's star and crew were unable to work at the station due to the ""Sneaks"" incident.

The show produced its first non-canon television show in 2003 but not in 2002. The show premiered in 2006 without a single show airing in a show's first year. In that year, Discovery had two original Trek series' in its first season.

2) Discovery didn't have negative outcomes.

The show averaged one negative result every two episodes, and the results were very positive so far.

"Fox News analyst Lawrence Jones and the 'Outnumbered' panel debate growing calls from liberal leaders to defund and dismantle U.S. police departments.Many top Democrats seemingly are reluctant to speak out on the sudden momentum behind the movement to ?defund the police,?ÿas Minneapolis lawmakers announceÿthey have the votes to do just that in their city -- the epicenter of the nation's unrest over the past two weeks following the death of George Floyd.House and Senate Democrats on Monday held a news conference to unveil sweeping new legislation that, if passed, would increase accountability of police officers by banning certain practices and curbing immunity from legal consequences stemming from acts committed in the line of duty.During the news conference, though, the ?defund the police? callsÿwere notÿexplicitly discussed as lawmakers guided the discussion more toward reform efforts.'DEFUND THE POLICE' WRESTS SUPPORT FROM POLITICIANS COAST-TO-COASTLater, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., were asked by a CNN reporter if they supported the movement to defund the police entirely.?That?s a local decision,? Pelosi said, noting that they would have ?those debates at the local level.??That doesn?t mean we?re going to pile more money on to further militarize police,? she reportedlyÿadded, without directly addressing whether she supports the radical step some local activists are demanding.Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., was in a similar position on ABC?s ?The View,? where she avoided directly answering whether she backs the movement.?We need to reimagine how we are achieving public safety in America,? she said, noting that cities that direct ?one-third of the budget to police? instead of ?public schools, job training and job creation?come on. We have to be honest with this.?Fox News is told top House Democrats warned rank-and-file members on a conference call Monday about being sucked into a debate about defunding the police, amid concerns about its impact on their election chances.Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser last week dedicated ""Black Lives Matter Plaza"" on a street near the White House. Later, protesters added an equals sign and the words ""defund the police"" to the mural. When asked whether she would remove the unauthorized changes to her government's street mural on ABC's ""This Week,"" Bowser was noncommittal.""We certainly are very proud of the D.C. mural that we commissioned and our department of public works and local artists installed. It is an affirmative piece of art,"" she said, not answering the host's question. When asked again, Bowser said, ""[i]t's not a part of the mural and we certainly encourage expression, but we are using the city streets for city art...

"TONIGHT: Watch Jacobin in conversation with End of Policing author Alex Vitale on YouTube ? 6pm ET.Last Monday, a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd by kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Protests that began early last week in Minneapolis spread to city after city, and by the weekend they had snowballed into nationwide mass civil unrest, which continues into this week.Jacobin?s Meagan Day spoke to Alex Vitale, professor of sociology and coordinator of the Policing and Social Justice Project at Brooklyn College and author of The End of Policing, about the mass demonstrations underway and the political experiences and ideas that are animating it. It?s so strange and unexpected to see a resurgence of protests against police brutality in this moment, of all moments, with the COVID-19 pandemic in full swing and much of the nation still theoretically in coronavirus-related lockdown. I didn?t even expect to see people protesting the inadequate coronavirus response en masse, much less protesting racist police violence. How can we make sense of this?It is kind of shocking. I also assumed that the social distancing imperatives would dramatically curtail street protest. But I think we?re in a moment of profound crisis that goes far beyond policing, and that the coronavirus crisis and the coming economic depression are part of what?s driving this. It?s the convergence of a bunch of different factors. Completely unreformed brutal policing is just the catalyst that has unleashed a kind of generational activism that?s responding to a deeper crisis, which policing is part of and emblematic of.I see many different kinds of people at the protests. There are poor and working-class black people, but there are also young white people, many presumably from middle-class backgrounds. That seems to support what you?re saying, that the protests are driven by anger both at police violence against black people in particular, and at a wider variety of social phenomena.I think what we?re seeing is the residuum of Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, and the Sanders campaign, movements united by a sense that our basic economic system is not working. Even people who don?t personally experience police violence see a future of economic and environmental collapse and are terrified and angry. If we had a booming economy, it would mute this. If we had credible leadership in Washington, it would mute this. But not only is Trump in the White House, I don?t think that anyone believes Biden is going to fix it.ÿWhen we think about the urban uprisings of the 1960s, we don?t think of them as being solely about policing. We understand that policing incidents were a trigger, but that they were a response to a deep problem of racial and economic inequality in America. That?s how we have to understand what?s happening today. Police are the public face of the failure of the state to provide for people?s basic needs, and to paper over that failure with solutions that just harm people further.It?s surprising to say, but these protests seem to have a greater intensity than the earlier Black Lives Matter protests did. It?s like Ferguson and Baltimore, but in dozens upon dozens of cities. Why might this be?One of the reasons of protests are more intense today than they were five years ago is that five years ago people were told, ?Don?t worry, we?re going to take care of it. We?re going to give the police some implicit bias training. We?re going to have some community meetings. We?re going to give them some body cameras and it?s all going to get better.? And five years later, it?s not better. Nothing has changed. People are not going to listen to any more pablum about community meetings.ÿMinneapolis is a liberal city in both the best and the worst senses of the word. Five years ago, they fully embraced the idea that they could get out of their policing problem by having people sit around and talk about racism. They tried all these tactics to restore community trust in the police while at the same time the police were permitted to on waging a war on drugs, a war on gangs, a war on crime, and criminalizing poverty and mental illness and homelessness.It?s not just Minneapolis. One of the things you heard a lot was this idea that we needed to jail killer cops. This is a dead-end strategy. First of all, the legal system is designed to protect police. It?s not an accident. It?s not a bug. It?s a feature. Secondly, when police are prosecuted, the system tosses them out and says, ?Oh they were a bad apple. We got rid of them. See, the system works.?ÿSo people are realizing this type of procedural reform will do nothing to change policing. Where?s the evidence? Well, we jailed a killer cop in Chicago last year. Nobody in Chicago is dancing in the streets about how great policing is right now.ÿI perceive a growing popular awareness that the police are what society has in lieu of a decent welfare state. Do you agree that people are increasingly connecting their negative feelings about policing to a positive desire for a transformational economic reform agenda?ÿAbsolutely. I mean, we?ve seen the signs on the street this past week that say, ?Defund the police.? That slogan really embodies this idea that we?re not going to fix the police, but instead we have to reduce them in every way we possibly can and replace them with democratic, public, non-police solutions. This idea has been building for the last five years, because the longer people have stayed engaged with the problems of policing and criminalization, the more they learn firsthand how pointless these reforms are. More people are recognizing that shrinking the police apparatus and replacing it with publicly-financed alternatives is the way forward.And by the same token, any effort to produce a multiracial working-class movement has to have dialing back the carceral apparatus of the state as part of its platform. Mass incarceration and mass criminalization are a direct threat to all our political projects. They foment racial division, undermine solidarity, instill fear, reduce the resources at our disposal, put activists in precarious positions, and will always directly subvert our movements.ÿThe procedural reformers are caught in this mythic understanding of American society. They believe that the neutral professional enforcement of the law is automatically beneficial for everyone, that the rule of law sets us all free. But this is a gross misunderstanding of the nature of the legal frameworks within which we live. These frameworks do not benefit everyone equally. There?s a famous nineteenth-century saying that the law forbids both the rich and the poor from sleeping under bridges, begging in the streets, and stealing bread. But of course the rich don?t do those things. Only the poor do.Ultimately policing is about maintaining a system of private property that allows exploitation to continue. It has been a tool for facilitating regimes of exploitation since the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. When most modern police forces were formed, those regimes were colonialism, slavery, and industrialization. Policing emerged to manage their consequences ? to suppress slave revolts, to put down colonial uprisings, to force the working class to behave as a stable workforce that doesn?t act out.ÿAnd that is the fundamental nature of policing. It?s a force that has never been interested in producing equality, just the opposite. It?s existed to suppress our movements and to allow exploitation to proceed.What does defunding the police look like in practice?ÿPractically, on a local level, it means trying to build a majoritarian politics on the ground to compel a city council to vote to cut the budget for the police and reinvest as much of that money as possible in community needs.ÿFor example, in New York City the Democratic Socialists of America have been doing issue advocacy around issues of criminalization for some time. Now they?re planning for next year?s city council races to make one of their key litmus tests whether or not the candidates seeking endorsement will support a program of reducing the budget for policing by a billion dollars. They?re helping to put this on the radar in a practical way. And just this week, forty candidates for next year?s city council races signed a pledge to defund the NYPD. That?s incredible.I?m the coordinator for the Policing and Social Justice Project, which is part of a movement in New York for budget justice. We put out the target of one billion. Other groups like Communities United for Police Reform and Close Rikers have called for substantial reductions to policing and reinvesting that money in community needs. So we?re all participating in budget hearings, writing op-eds, we released a video that?s circulating on social media, including paid advertising, that calls for this billion cut. We?re making a real push to defund the police not in theory but in practice.And then it?s important to lobby to divert or reallocate that money in ways that actually directly replace the function of policing. So for example, in New York City the Public Safety Committee makes its recommendation about the police budget, other committees make their recommendations to other departments, but there?s a Budget Committee chair who can send signals to those different subcommittees. So the Budget Committee chair who we?re targeting in New York could say to the Public Safety Committee, ?Hey we want you to take two hundred million out of the police budget,? and then he could say to the Education Committee, ?You?ve got an extra hundred million to put in, but I want you to put it into counselors and restorative justice.?Polls consistently show that even though many people, especially people of color and in particular black people, distrust the police, they don?t actively want the number of officers in their neighborhood reduced. I suspect that disconnect owes to people?s automatic equation of police with safety: people want to feel safer, and policing is the only solution to public safety on offer. Why do you think this gap exists, and how do we bridge it?I think it?s analogous to the situation with Bernie Sanders. You saw the exit polls showing that people liked Sanders?s ideas but voted for Biden. They?re afraid. They?re not ready. They have a stake in conformity and they don?t trust this new thing, even though on some level they understand and believe in it.When it comes to police, we?re dealing with a forty-year legacy of people being told that the only thing they can have to fix any problem in their neighborhood ? loose dogs, noise complaints, rowdy teenagers ? is more police. That?s the only option. So people have been conditioned to think, ?Oh, if I have a problem, it?s a problem for the police to solve.? When people say they want police, they?re saying they want fewer problems.We really have to break out of this thinking. We have to empower people to actually ask for what they want, and we also have to equip people with more examples of things that they could demand that would actually make their communities healthier and safer. A lot of people would agree that it would be better if they had a new community center, for example. They just don?t believe it?s possible. They think, ?There?s no point asking for that, cause they?re never going to give us that.?ÿWe need to be putting concrete alternatives out there. For example, mental health crisis calls have become major part of what police to every day in New York City. There are seven hundred of them a day. We don?t need police to do that work, and in fact we don?t want armed police doing that work, because it?s dangerous for people having mental health crises. We need to create a twenty-four-hour non-police mental health crisis response system. Jumaane Williams in New York City has called for exactly that in an excellent detailed report. The proposal is to take the money that?s spent on police crisis calls and shift it over to delivering mental health services.ÿIt?s a concrete idea for an alternative to policing. We need more of those to instill a sense of possibility and optimism, and broaden people?s imaginations.",human

"Kamala Harris avoids question on whether she backs 'defund the police' movement

In the U.S., nearly a third of American Muslims don't have access to any guns, after more than a quarter of them are killed by cops, a new study found.

Data from a 2016 Pew Research Center survey taken by the Federal Police found just 12 percent of American Muslims say policing is ""an important part of their community,"" including the nation's youngest Muslims, and most of those younger than 30, including both young and older adults.

Many Muslims believe that, more than anything else, policing is a way to protect them.

""The biggest problem is I need to get out of my seat in the house, make sure the police are out of my way,"" said Chih-chai Bibi, a Muslim from South Lake Union, Arizona. ""But the only way I can stop it is to know who I am. The worst thing I can say is to be a Muslim in the sense, that they are not as nice as I think.""

Muslims also hold views that differ significantly among those who say they support or oppose terrorism. An overwhelming majority of them say the government should be vigilantes, with only one-third in a college-aged white suburban community, compared to only half-a-quarter in a predominantly black city. Most of those they say have no religion.

""This country is a lot more likely to be killed by police than most other countries in the U.S.,"" said Dina Salhoba, co-director of the nonprofit Community Policing Policies Project, which works with American Muslim communities to improve the relationship between law enforcement and religious minorities.

""I would argue if you're a Black Muslim and you're being threatened by a Muslim, then you're not being safe,"" she noted.

Though the country's top law-enforcement officials have often been reluctant to condemn police brutality, the belief that terrorism is a necessary evil has gained traction in the U.S. in recent years. Even American mosques in the early 1990s held vigils offering mourns.

""These prayers were meant to help people who struggled with suicide, and as a result, they were doing so with violence,"" said David Williams, a professor at George Mason University. Williams, who directs the American Civil Liberties Union's Criminal Justice Project, said that while he agrees that America's law-enforcement system is broken, the likelihood is that it is evolving, and that many police killings have been linked to an increase in ""hate cases,"" he said.

""I think when we do that, we're going to get more and more of these incidents,"" he said.

But some experts said they expect to see a wave of Muslim arrests and arrests in the coming months.

""In the past four years, we've seen an increase in Islamic police arrests,"" said Robert Nye, a former deputy sheriff emeritus at New York, where the FBI investigated the attempted killing of a Muslim by a Muslim. Nye said that while he believes that Muslims should be ""discouraged"" about the issue, he said a wave could be expected.

""I would say there are still problems,"" Nye said. ""But I also recognize that if you do not get this attention and it's happening in the real world, then it is hard to get any of them, and I would agree that the most important issue is religion.""<|endoftext|>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a moderate Republican, said on Tuesday his campaign plans for Trump to withdraw from the Paris climate accord ""may not have been the best idea"" so far as an anti-treaty, U.S. president-elect.

Rubio, 52, is in Washington on Monday, where he is hoping for the full withdrawal sign-ups by the end of the year, a U.S. official close to discussions told Reuters. Rubio is expected in Washington to sign an official climate agreement by May 16 at the White House. His aides said that although he was unlikely to pull out.

Rubio's decision to vote no on a Trump administration climate deal would represent a U.S. retreat from the Paris accord. Many U.S. officials and policymakers have argued that the agreement is not going to work, and the main goal of the Trump administration was to avoid any major catastrophe.

""I think that he is going to step down,"" said Lawrence Wright, a senior official in Iraq who was not authorized to speak publicly on a condition of anonymity to discuss Rubio's plans. ""I have no doubt that his approach to solving this is going to be the best for his country.""

""It is clear that our system of policing is not keeping our communities safe. Our efforts at incremental reform have failed, period.""As protests against police brutality and racial injustice garner momentum, here are some changes officials have proposed at the state, local and federal level aimed at defunding the police and instituting other reforms: Congress:House and Senate Democrats on Monday are expected to unveil the new ?Justice in Policing Act of 2020,? which includes major overhauls for how police officers around the country will do their jobs. It includes prohibiting the use of chokeholds, lowering legal standards to pursue criminal and civil penalties for police misconduct, and banning certain no-knock warrants, NPR reported, citing a Democratic congressional aide. ""These are commonsense changes that, frankly, will create a far greater level of accountability for those police officers who violate the law, who violate our rights and who violate our common community standards,"" Sen.

""Persistent, unchecked bias in policing and a history of lack of accountability is wreaking havoc on the black community. Cities are literally on fire with the pain and anguish wrought by the violence visited upon black and brown bodies,"" the bill?s sponsors wrote in a letter to colleagues Saturday. ""While there is no single policy prescription that will erase the decades of systemic racism and excessive policing ? it's time we create structural change with meaningful reforms.""Though Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., have recognized ?egregious wrongs,? in police brutality cases, GOP lawmakers were not included in the drafting of the bill and, therefore, are expected to initially oppose the measure.""I think we can easily find common ground on both sides and we can do it swiftly, but it's more difficult if you're away,"" House Minority Leader Rep.

""Members of Congress should not be called back for one week and say, 'Here are all the bills.'""New York City:New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Sunday he would accede to protesters? demands by moving to shift funds away from the NYPD toward youth and social services. De Blasio, whose already contemptuous relationship with the NYPD has only worsened as critics say he failed to get a handle on civil unrest following Floyd?s death, did not go into detail on how much money would be allocated away from the police force. He vowed to announce specifics before the July 1 budget deadline. The NYPD currently has a $6 billion annual budget ? about 6 percent of de Blasio?s proposed $90 billion budget for the city. ?We?re committed to seeing a shift of funding to youth services, to social services, that will happen literally in the course of the next three weeks, but I?m not going to go into detail because it is subject to negotiation and we want to figure out what makes sense,? the mayor said Sunday. The latest reforms were developed by the mayor?s task force on racial inclusion and equity, which is co-chaired by his wife, Chirlane McCray, who is black. Besides shifting funds from the NYPD to youth and social services, the changes also include moving the enforcement for street vending out of the NYPD to a civilian agency, and creating community ambassadors to the NYPD to act as liaisons between officers and civilians, WCBS-TV reported. ?People did not protest for the sake of protest. They protest to achieve change, and now we must deliver that change,? de Blasio said in his news briefing. He said community ambassadors would be ?people from the community, civilians deeply steeped in their communities with the ability to bring the concerns of the community to the highest levels of the NYPD, to bring back answers, including the status on disciplinary cases and changes in policing that needs to be done to allow better policing, fairer policing.? The mayor did not address demands made by dozens of employees inÿhis own Office of Criminal Justice on Saturday. They proposed several police reforms, including a move to criminalize the use of chokeholds by officers, which would make it easier for district attorneys to prosecute infractions. De Blasio refused to sign the measure without an exemption for members of law enforcement in life-threatening situations, the New York Times reported. Los AngelesLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Wednesday that he tasked the city to ?identify $250 million in cuts? to invest more money into the black community, communities of color, womenÿand ?people who have been left behind.""The Los Angeles Times reported the city will try and cut between $100 million to $150 million from its police budget alone. ?While our work for racial justice begins in L.A., it must echo throughout our state and across our nation. I will keep working with leaders in Sacramento and D.C. to advance legislation that protects black lives and communities of color long denied equity in our laws,? Garcetti tweeted on Friday. The mayor also announced he would launch the city's new Civil and Human Rights Department and Civil and Human Rights Commission this summer to ?protect anyone who lives, works inÿor visits L.A. from discrimination or denial of equal treatment in private employment, housing, educationÿor commerce.?Garcetti said he supported the work done by members of the California black caucus to ?restore voting rights to those serving parole, improve emergency response services for historically neglected communities, and seek reparations for the impact of slavery.?

"On June 23, New Yorkers will go to the polls to vote in their state?s primary elections, and many voters in New York City will have the opportunity to cast their ballots for outspoken socialist organizers. In addition to incumbents Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and New York state senator Julia Salazar, there are five socialist challengers backed by New York City DSA running for state and national office.One of those candidates is Jabari Brisport, who is campaigning for the New York State Senate seat in District 25. The seat is open, and Brisport?s main opponent, Tremaine Wright, is a current State Assembly member with close ties to the relatively conservative Democratic establishment in Brooklyn. That, of course, goes along with taking money from the likes of real estate lobbyists and a billionaire-funded charter school PAC.Brisport, on the other hand, is a public school teacher who advocates rent control, a homes guarantee, police defunding, fully funded public education, and a charter school moratorium; in short, a full-throated and direct socialist challenge to business-as-usual Brooklyn machine politics.Born and raised in Brooklyn, Brisport?s experience in political life has straddled the worlds of electoral politics and on-the-ground movement building. Having joined Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) during its upsurge in the wake of Donald Trump?s election, he has been organizing as an open socialist since then. In 2017, he ran a campaign to challenge a powerful incumbent for a City Council seat, and he has been an active participant in a wide array of movements as well as New York City DSA. Most recently, he has been playing a frontline role in the ongoing Black Lives Matter uprising, as well as working as a rank-and-file teacher and unionist in the New York City public school system.Can you tell us a little bit about your experience over the last several weeks? Between teaching middle schoolers during a pandemic, being on the front lines of the Black Lives Matter uprisings, and entering electoral campaign crunch time, I imagine you?ve been very busy.This is unlike anything I have ever done in my entire life, but really that?s just a reflection of the fact that the United States has never gone through anything quite like this current moment. I?ve heard someone give a good description of living in this moment as a mixture of the 1918 Spanish Flu, the Great Depression, and also the social upheavals of the 1960s, all rolled into one. It?s been quite an experience to participate in all of this. So my team and our community are all doing our best to cope with rapidly changing situations.To be honest, my students are struggling. They were struggling going into distance learning and worried about the pandemic, and now they?re struggling even more because most of my students are black, and many are scared. When we did a debrief about the protests, one of my students said, ?Mr Brisport, I?m scared that when real school starts again, and I have to take the subway, a cop will pull me aside and accuse me of having a gun.?And that?s a really disturbing thing to hear an eleven-year-old boy say, because in my ideal world, he would just be talking about sports or music or pro wrestling or whatever kids are enjoying these days. But that?s his fear right now.On top of all that, Election Day is coming up quickly, and we are all doing our best to keep our heads on our shoulders. This is my second campaign, so I know that this is the time when everyone?s phones start exploding, and everyone comes out wanting to help. It?s lovely and powerful, but it?s also a challenge to connect volunteers with roles in the campaign at such a quick pace.Taking a step back, can you tell me a little bit about how you got into political organizing?I actually came to my political organizing through identity issues ? before I came to class struggle. My first political experiences were fighting for same-sex marriage as a queer man. I was involved in a big fight to get a same-sex marriage bill passed through the New York State Senate ? which I?m now running to be part of. The first attempt in 2009 failed, and it really hurt to be seen as a second-class citizen, but we redoubled and fought again. And then in 2011, we won same-sex marriage in New York.Starting a couple years later, I began to get more radicalized by the Black Lives Matter movement, because, for me, it was no longer an issue just of getting to marry the person I love, but about the fact that I could, at any point, be shot and killed by a police officer.When I was nineteen, an undercover police officer put a gun to my face. I was with a friend, and we were walking, and he just grabbed my friend because he ?matched the description? of a drug dealer, which was just ?white guy with a hoodie.? The undercover officer just grabbed him from nowhere, never showed a badge, never read him any rights, never even identified himself as police. When I started telling them that, he put a gun to my face for ?getting loud with him.?So when the Black Lives Matter movement came, this fear of becoming the next hashtag really got to me. It really politicized me to be up in the streets marching and making demands.Then, in 2016, when Bernie Sanders ran for and lost the Democratic primary, I started looking more into democratic socialism. It was my thinking on race, actually, that helped me come out of the closet as a socialist. I was in the shower one day, thinking about slavery and how, in the end, it was really just linked to capitalism. Black people were brought here as literal capital, had price tags slapped on them and sold on markets, treated as commodities and were, in turn, used to create commodities. Racism has been tied into capitalism from the very beginning, even after slavery with sharecropping and Jim Crow, redlining, policing. All of these systems have been about turning a profit on the backs of black people.And that really pushed me to explore more class analysis and look at how capitalism and racism were so intertwined, you couldn?t really get rid of one without the other.I?m curious to hear how your experience as a public school teacher in New York City has informed both your concrete platform and your broader political vision.You can see from such a visceral, on-the-ground perspective all the ways in which the current political system fails our students.I have one girl who is tired all the time in class, and when I check in, it?s because she was up late because she had to sleep at her auntie?s house, or at her grandma?s. It?s obvious that she doesn?t have a secure place to sleep every right. And how can she learn when she doesn?t have her basic needs met?Another student of mine was struggling, and then one day just stopped showing up. I got an email from his mom a few days later saying they had to move abruptly to Long Island because they were evicted. That really broke my heart and made me angry ? this system does not do enough for our students.And then there?s the typical teacher stuff: being low on supplies, not having enough money for textbooks for everyone, and we?re out of paper on day two. So, you know, us teachers are digging through our pockets to help. But then stuff just comes up that?s beyond my scope as a teacher. When my sixth-grade student told me he?s afraid of cops accusing him of having a gun, it was overwhelming.This is all because of misplaced priorities in our schools, in our society, the fact that we don?t invest in housing and other essential services as human rights. We have money for cops and we don?t have money for social workers or nurses or other health professionals, you know, the things our communities actually need. It?s so visceral, these are children, and it can be heartbreaking. And it just makes me want to fight so much harder.Obviously, we are in the midst of an uprising across this country and across the world in defense of black lives, and against police and state repression. What are your thoughts on the DefundNYPD campaign and on similar campaigns to defund local police departments and shift money toward education, health care, and social services?I love the DefundNYPD campaign right now. But I want to make sure that we can solidify the narrative over what ?defunding? means. It literally means taking funds away, it does not mean the ?8 Can?t Wait? campaign. There?s nothing technically wrong with some of those reforms, but they?re just not going to do the job. It?s not about better management or training of police, it?s about taking away money and power from them.There?s this big pot of money, the $6 billion NYPD budget that can be redirected, and, of course, a state budget where funds could be redirected into social services that also give people stability.And I really appreciate hearing more and more people talking about what police abolition could actually look like. It?s becoming much more prevalent, and people are understanding the negative role police play in society.There are many white, wealthy suburbs and communities where police are not just patrolling the streets or do not hang out on the corner in case something is quote-unquote ?wrong.? They don?t knock on doors in the middle of the night to check and make sure you are not a drug dealer, and they definitely don?t shoot you in your head while you are sleeping at home. We can start to think about abolition in these ways.When people are invested deeply in making sure that every single person has a home, has a job, has health care, and that their kids have access to good education, that?s where public safety and security comes from. Everyone, including wealthy white people, knows in the back of their minds where public safety comes from. It comes from having your basic needs met and having a community where people feel like they can take care of each other and not always being on the verge of crisis. So why can?t everybody have that?And, of course, the crisis of racialized police violence is not the only major crisis we face right now. What kinds of socialist policies are you advocating for to address the public health impacts and the looming economic depression triggered by the coronavirus pandemic?In the immediate sense, we need to push back against any and all cuts to education, health care, and basic social services. People are struggling right now, and the last thing we need to do is enact austerity on things like Medicaid or anything that working-class people rely on.The flip side is to push for greater taxes on the wealthy. Governors will complain of tax revenue going down, but there is so much money out there that we need to fight for. The billionaires have gotten even richer during this pandemic. There is money there that can be put into our communities, but we need to fight for it.There is an opportunity for us to directly say, right now, that certain people in society are harming the rest of us by hoarding their wealth. People are literally dying right now because billionaires are using this unprecedented disaster to enrich themselves. They are not doing the humane thing, which would be sharing that wealth.More specifically, in the state legislature, there are some concrete pieces of legislation that need to be passed immediately. First and foremost is rent cancellation. In Ithaca, New York, they recently canceled rent, so we have a precedent. We also obviously need to have good cause eviction. We need to start expanding and extending those protections, especially if we are able to cancel mortgages. If you cancel rent, cancel mortgages, and cancel utilities during this crisis, that will go a long way toward helping people survive. Everyone should support this program unless you are a staunch capitalist who wants to make sure you get your returns on investment.Finally, this crisis has really exposed the danger of our prisons, especially for public health. Coronavirus has exploded in our jails and detention facilities, so we need to push for things like releasing aging people, decriminalizing sex work, decriminalizing drug possession, legalizing marijuana, abolishing mandatory minimums, and do everything we can to reduce incarceration levels. We need to use this pandemic to fundamentally reevaluate how we structure our society.The DSA national convention last summer passed a ?Class-Struggle Electoral Strategy.? What does it mean to you to be a class-struggle candidate, and what would it mean to be a class-struggle elected official?It?s socialists ? class-struggle candidates ? who are not afraid to name the forces that we are up against. We have to claim, explicitly and repeatedly, that there is an extremely wealthy class in our society that does not contribute to the greater good, and they have enormous influence over our politics and our society. So we are not afraid to name our enemies and push against them.The main difference between a socialist candidate and a ?progressive? is that we socialists insist on fundamental changes and not technocratic solutions. One big distinction between my campaign and one of my opponents, who is a self-described ?progressive,? is that his solution on housing for months has been ?we need to end tax abatements, which go to luxury developers.? Which, like, is true, and is a fine policy.But it?s not an actual, structural solution. As socialists, we ultimately understand that if we want to end the housing crisis, we need to tax the rich and de-commodify housing. It?s very easy to make a technocratic solution that doesn?t address the root of the problem and then seem like you?re very well versed on the topic. At the end of the day, it has to do with how we name our enemies and how we take power back from them.I?m also really excited about NYC-DSA?s whole slate of class-struggle candidates! We have me, Phara Souffrant Forrest, Marcela Mitaynes, Zohran Kwame Mamdani, and Samelys L¢pez. We?ve released joint platforms, done joint videos, press statements, organizing events, and raised money jointly. We have joint literature and campaign materials.This is a collaboration of socialist candidates that, I think, has never been seen before, or at least for a very long time. If we really believe in socialism and having working people coming together, collaborating and collectively owning things, that has to be demonstrated in our political process. I?m so honored to be part of this group, and hopefully we will bring in new socialist elected officials in coming years.Having a large and collaborative slate lets socialists share resources and skills, and bring a bigger and more unified message. And there?s power in numbers: having Julia Salazar out there saying we need to have rent control or defund the police, that?s amazing and has helped change the conversation. Imagine what it will be like when a slate of six or seven elected officials can organize in our communities and really push the agenda. When socialists win elections, it helps amplify and give mass credibility to the ideas brought forward by our movements.",human
"WASHINGTON ? As Americans were clamoring in the streets last week to defund the police and as Democrats in Congress were drafting legislation to make it easier to track and prosecute officer misconduct, Larry Cosme, a leader of the police lobby, was at the White House making a direct appeal to some of President Trump?s top advisers against some of the most consequential reforms.At a meeting in the State Dining Room that included Mr. Trump, Attorney General William P. Barr and Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, Mr. Cosme and about two dozen others listened as families of victims of police violence spoke emotionally of the need for a different approach, and pledged that they were ready to make some changes.But afterward, Mr. Cosme, the president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, pulled aside Mr. Scott, who was putting the finishing touches on Republicans? policing bill, and Mr. Barr to push back against two of the most aggressive ideas under consideration: peeling back qualified immunity, the legal doctrine that shields police officers from lawsuits, and building a national database of civilian complaints against them.He left the meeting unworried. ?Attorney General Barr assured us it wouldn?t go that far,? Mr. Cosme recalled.Indeed, the bill that Mr. Scott introduced the next day fell well short of that, and on Wednesday, it stalled in the Senate, as Democrats called it a woefully inadequate response to the problem of systemic racism in law enforcement. They pushed their own, far more aggressive measure through the House on Thursday, but it too has little chance of survival in the face of Republican opposition.The resulting stalemate reflects the vast ideological gulf between the two parties and the legislative paralysis that has taken hold in Congress, where striking an election-year deal to overhaul policing was always going to be a challenge. But it is also partly a result of a quiet but successful federal lobbying campaign by law enforcement organizations and their representatives, who have spent decades building relationships in Congress and waging a persistent influence campaign of policy advocacy, political contributions and endorsements.Staring down a bipartisan swell of momentum in Congress for passing policing legislation in response to throngs of protests against police brutality and racial bias, the groups have swung into action on Capitol Hill in recent weeks to wage a little-publicized campaign against the most sweeping reforms proposed by lawmakers: stripping officers of qualified immunity, ending no-knock warrants and building a national database of complaints against the police.Just as unions have fought aggressively across the country to fend off changes, they have used their clout in Washington to resist new federal mandates or restrictions. Their power helps explain why Republicans have rejected some of the most aggressive measures to rein in police tactics, and why Democrats ? sensing political advantage on the issue ? appear to have calculated, at least for now, that their legislation is not even worth debating.?We?re not going to abdicate our rights,? said Mr. Cosme, whose association has spent nearly $400,000 lobbying Congress since 2017. ?We?re going to come out swinging. We?re not going to back down.?They have found sympathetic ears at the White House, where Mr. Trump has declared himself the ?president of law and order,? and open doors in the Senate, where Republican lawmakers refused to embrace any changes until they received assurances from law enforcement groups that they would not oppose the efforts.?Too often we?re having a discussion in this nation about are you supporting the law enforcement community or are you supporting communities of color,? Mr. Scott said as he unveiled his bill. ?This is a false binary choice.?After conversations with Mr. Scott and his staff, Sheriff David Mahoney, the incoming president of the National Sheriffs? Association, said his team was able to ?massage some of the language? in the Republican bill to bring in ?perspectives that would be more consistent with the needs of law enforcement.??They made a commitment to continue working with law enforcement,? Mr. Mahoney said.His calls to Speaker Nancy Pelosi?s office, by contrast, were not returned.?I?ve not heard back from them, which is unfortunate because I?ve spoken with the staff and the speaker on many occasions,? Mr. Mahoney said.That dynamic reflects the shifting political terrain now facing police unions and advocacy organizations on Capitol Hill, as they try to weather a national outcry in favor of placing stricter restrictions on their profession.For years, powerful police organizations have resisted calls for major changes in the way they do their jobs, even after the widespread protests of 2015 over the killing of black people by the police. They have been successful in doing so partly through their lobbying and campaign activity, and partly because members of both political parties feared alienating them and being portrayed as ?soft on crime.?Six of the larger police organizations have spent a combined $2.9 million since 2017 lobbying the federal government. And various law enforcement entities have contributed more than $100,000 to members of Congress this election cycle, roughly evenly split between Republicans and Democrats.They are known for their annual lobbying trips to Washington in May, when unions send representatives to glad-hand with lawmakers, staying in four-star hotels near Capitol Hill, meeting with their aides and celebrating them with yearly awards luncheons.Law enforcement groups have condemned the killing of George Floyd during an encounter with the police in Minneapolis as ?morally bankrupt? and a ?betrayal of the public trust.? In response, they have embraced some reform efforts, including restrictions on chokeholds, the creation of a database of officers fired for misconduct, and increased federal funding for training in de-escalation techniques and the widespread use of body-worn cameras.But they have fiercely fought the most far-reaching changes advocated by civil rights groups and most Democrats. They argue that stripping officers of qualified immunity could bankrupt officers over accusations that end up being false. They oppose banning no-knock warrants, which they say could endanger officers entering the homes of people with guns. And they have pushed hard against building a database cataloging all accusations ? proven or not ? against the police, which they view as a privacy violation.?We welcome change, but we welcome change with an open dialogue and a seat at the table,? Mr. Cosme said.The House passed a bill on Thursday that contained several provisions the police groups opposed. The sweeping measure would effectively end qualified immunity for officers, make it easier to track and prosecute police misconduct, strictly limit the use of lethal force and aim to compel departments to ban chokeholds and other tactics that can cut off individuals? airways. It contains no new funding for police departments.The legislation won the support of three moderate Republicans, who joined a united bloc of Democrats to back the measure. It is expected to run into a brick wall in the Senate, where Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has called it ?typical Democratic overreach.?Mr. Scott?s measure, by contrast, has won the support of police groups, who were pleased that it included more than $1 billion in federal grants for training and equipping the police and were relieved that it did not alter the qualified immunity doctrine that shields officers from lawsuits or mandate any other changes they are resisting.The vast divergence reflects a political shift that is threatening to sap some of the historically bipartisan influence of police organizations at the federal level. Moderate Democrats in Congress have long seen endorsements and perfect grades from law enforcement groups as a way to emphasize their law-and-order credentials, a prerequisite for political success in many conservative-leaning districts.But as polls show the Black Lives Matter movement gaining purchase nationwide and as protests against police brutality spring up in suburban districts, the strident opposition of unions and other police groups has lost some of its bite. When House Democrats unveiled their expansive police reform legislation, even the most politically vulnerable lawmakers signed on as sponsors.Representative Josh Gottheimer, Democrat of New Jersey, a self-described moderate who boasts of a 100 percent score from the National Association of Police Organizations, quickly signed on to the Democrats? bill.He said representatives of local police unions in New Jersey are not thrilled about some of the reform efforts, but they concede the profession needs to change.?They know they need reform,? Mr. Gottheimer said. ?They?ll accept a lot of it. There?s parts of it they are more willing to accept than others.?Aides to top Democrats say police unions have lost some sway inside the party, as its most progressive members call for dismantling departments outright. More than two dozen House Democrats ? including Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan ? have signed a ?No Cash From Cops? pledge saying they will not take any campaign contributions from police unions.Representative Kweisi Mfume, Democrat of Maryland and a former N.A.A.C.P. president, said he had seen more give this year from law enforcement groups like the Fraternal Order of Police than in previous eras.?The sort of reflexive action by F.O.P.s around the country has been to push back and not want to accommodate,? Mr. Mfume said. ?But because these protests are so massive and so enlarged, there might be more of a willingness now than ever before.?Senator Mike Braun, Republican of Indiana and a lonely proponent in his party for stripping away police officers? qualified immunity, said he believed that as instances of police violence continued to grab headlines, law enforcement groups would come around to bigger changes.?It?s giving them a bad rap,? Mr. Braun said. ?Nobody wants to change the status quo when it?s heavily in your favor ? until you need to.?",human
"The president stands firm during his roundtable with law enforcement officials at the White House; John Roberts reports.Virtually everything has been going against President Trump in recent weeks, but he just caught a major political break.With the exception of a rebounding stock market, Trump has been battered politically by a raging pandemic, a calamitous economic shutdown, and two weeks of protests over the killing of George Floyd that have spread from the largest cities to the smallest towns.He has been castigated by a slew of former military men -- from Jim Mattis and Mike Mullen to Colin Powell -- while drawing sharp criticism from the Catholic archbishop and the Episcopal bishop of Washington.NEW YORK TIMES FIASCO: MEDIA BRING TRUMP MODEL TO RACIAL ISSUESAnd in a spate of polls, Trump is getting low marks for handling the protests, and slipping behind Joe Biden by anywhere from 7 to 14 points.But now comes a phrase that could transform the debate: defund the police.Those words, being pushed by left-wing groups, are in my view political suicide, and the Trump team is already doing everything possible to tar Biden with the slogan.Kayleigh McEnany wasted no time in telling reporters the president is ?appalled? by the movement. The White House press secretary said ?the fact that you have sitting congresswomen wanting to defund the police--notably Rashida Tlaib; notably Biden advisor AOC, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; former Clinton and Eric Holder spokesperson Brian Fallon wanting to defund our police across this country--it is extraordinary.?There?s the strategy, saying that much of the Democratic Party wants to go the defunding route, and hanging that albatross on Biden.The former vice president let Monday go by with just a terse statement from a spokesman. But when asked by CBS News anchor Norah O?Donnell, Biden said: ?No, I don?t support defunding the police. I support conditioning federal aid to police based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness.?This feels like a historic moment. In a stunning finding, a Washington Post poll finds 74 percent of Americans saying they support the protests that have engulfed the country. And while there?s a partisan divide, with 87 percent of Democrats backing the demonstrations, the Republicans in support--53 percent--are still a majority.SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIESMore important, 69 percent of those questioned say Floyd?s killing reflects a broader problem in law enforcement, while 29 percent view the Minneapolis tragedy as an isolated incident. Six years ago, after the killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson and Eric Garner on Staten Island, just 43 percent viewed these deaths as part of a larger problem, with 51 percent calling them isolated incidents.In that same poll, 61 percent disapprove of Trump?s handling of the protests, while 35 percent approve.And I can?t imagine that would improve after Trump tweeted a bizarre conspiracy theory about 75-year-old Martin Gugino, who is still hospitalized after being shoved by Buffalo police, saying he ?could be an ANTIFA provocateur? and ?fell harder than was pushed. Could be a setup?? His lawyer denies that, and two officers have been charged with assault.But if the tone of the president?s rhetoric isn?t matching the moment, people who have watched their cities burn surely want law and order, even if they are disgusted by police mistreatment of blacks. And that?s why ?defund the police? is such a toxic slogan, except perhaps on the Minneapolis City Council. Without police, who would respond to robberies, domestic violence, gang shootings?Even Bernie Sanders tells the New Yorker ?we want to redefine what police departments do,? not defund them.For those who say they just want to replace the existing departments with better ones that have a new mission, I?d ask, why are you using the word defund? You want police reform, and you still need to hire and train officers.Congressional Democrats, who took a knee at the Capitol, rolled out a bill that would, among other things, ban chokeholds, end racial profiling and make it easier to sue police officers who unjustly kill or injure people. The president has offered no police reforms, saying 99 percent of officers are good people.Some mayors, such as New York?s Bill de Blasio and Eric Garcetti in Los Angeles, are pushing to cut their police budgets and divert the money to social services, which may be good politics but doesn?t get at the root problem.If Biden strongly opposes the defunding movement, he?ll draw the wrath of left-wing activists. But they?ve opposed him since the day he got in the race. Liberals journalists agreed he was too old, too out of touch and insufficiently woke. Yet he clobbered his opponents, in no small part because of overwhelming support from African-Americans.Both Trump and Biden will try to cast this election as a referendum on who is best equipped to protect the country--from a pandemic, from economic ruin, from police brutality, from rioters. The outcome may ride on how those terms are defined.",human
"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams pushed back Sunday on calls to defund police departments across the country ? calling it ?a false choice idea? and arguing that reforming police departments is the best path forward.Abrams, whose name is frequently mentioned as being on the shortlist to be presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden?s running mate, said that what the United States needs is a ?reformation of how police officers do their jobs? and ?transformation in how we view the role of law enforcement.??We are being drawn into a false choice idea,? she said on ABC?s ?This Week? when asked about the ?Defund The Police? movement. ?The reality is we need two things,? she added. ?We?ll use different language to describe it, but, fundamentally, we must have reformation and transformation.?CALLS FOR BIDEN TO NAME A BLACK RUNNING MATE GROW LOUDERThe ?Defund The Police? movement arose amid the protests following the deaths of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Ky. The idea behind the movement varies between completely abolishing police departments to relocating the massive amount of funding many departments receive to other social programs.Groups like Black Lives Matter argue that it isn?t necessarily about eliminating police departments or stripping agencies of all of their money. They say it is time for the country to address systemic problems in policing in America and spend more on what communities across the U.S. need, like housing and education.State and local governments spent $115 billion on policing in 2017, according to data compiled by the Urban Institute.?Why can?t we look at how it is that we reorganize our priorities, so people don?t have to be in the streets during a national pandemic?"" Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza asked during an interview on NBC?s ?Meet the Press.?Biden has also come out against the idea of completely defunding the police, as have most Democrats in Congress.Instead, the House last week proposed a far-reaching overhaul of police procedures and accountability, saying their proposal would not eliminate police departments ? a decision for cities and states ? but establish new standards and oversight.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe Justice in Policing Act, the most ambitious law enforcement reform from Congress in years, confronts several aspects of policing that have come under strong criticism, as in-custody deaths are captured on cellphone video and shared widely across the nation and the world.The package would limit legal protections for police, create a national database of excessive-force incidents and ban police chokeholds, among other changes.It would revise the federal criminal police misconduct statute to make it easier to prosecute officers who are involved in ?reckless? misconduct and it would change ?qualified immunity? protections to more broadly enable damage claims against police in lawsuits.The legislation would ban racial profiling, boost requirements for police body cameras and limit the transfer of military equipment to local jurisdictions among other things.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

A public statement from the group Anti-Defund Police expressed their support for the arrest.

""We don't condone vandalism to any woman, no matter what the reason,"" Sara Adams, spokesperson for the DC Police Department told The Huffington Post. ""The MPD also believes in respect and civility.""

""Time will tell for some pretty strong feelings about our city,"" Adams said.

The city did not respond to a request for comment.

Under the ""Thousand Ways to Make Your City Awesome"" hashtag, it was reported that after the mural was installed at an African American church, many angry members of the LGBTQ community were attempting to protest at the church, which is located about 12 miles away in Baltimore.

One member of Crews' graffiti crew, who was arrested as cited, told HuffPost they were handcuffed and escorted from the mural while the Baltimore Police Department attempted to paint the scene.

The mural was removed from the Public Art Project of Baltimore on August 22, 2018 after taking it down from Instagram

While the city has recently been taking steps toward removing the artwork, the issue is not over. Last month, three homeless artists were charged with defacing official artwork in the city's Office of the Vice President of the Commonwealth. Baltimore City police arrested Mohammed Omer Yassin Al, 31, in May for breaking into the city's public works building and vandalizing the sidewalk of the Mall in Bethesda, Maryland, for more than four hours, according to the city's website.

New York City Police Commissioner James O'Neill said in a recent statement that ""The artist depicts an unknown historical object ? that is, a car ? in a recent post in a gallery.

The Baltimore Department was widely seen as a safe place for art, especially the public works side.

A statement released by the Baltimore Department said, ""Domestic violence is a critical issue, but it's never to be taken lightly. An attack on a queer person is an attack on all of us.""

The Baltimore Department of Public Works told HuffPost they work with artists to clean up graffiti, and their works can be offensive because the artwork is not meant for public consumption. The Baltimore Department of Public Works has removed large piles of artwork depicting sexual assault and child molestation from its permanent graffiti brush in May.

As part of the agreement, each city will pay the artist up to $1.15 million over the five years. Baltimore City Attorney Angela Corey has said she will proceed with the matter, which will be reviewed and approved by a team of police.<|endoftext|>Sneakers are hard to pin down, they're believed, but the government can't say they're racist. Just five days after reading this column, a jury is deadlocked on whether the Seattle city code enforcement agency that permits the sale of gasoline and diesel fuel in a San Francisco underground aqueduct has violated the terms of its settlement with RTV.

Ten city governments, including the District Attorney's office, have reached a settlement with the DA's office to cover some of the city's costs.

The agreement, signed by arbitrator Howard Schwab and district attorney Art Hogan, requires the city to reimburse the DA Office of Inspector General's office to anyone who had complained that the agency violated the terms of its contract for its underground diesel fuel unit.

The DA's office says the costs for monitoring violations against city law enforcement have been inflated and the city has set aside $15,000 to cover the legal fees.

A representative for the city declined to comment on the ongoing legal showdown between the city council and the DA's office. City officials say that since 2006, the City Council, the District Attorney office and the mayor's office have prospered on the issue of the issue, which allows them to make final decisions about what they deem to be the proper course of action.

It's unclear how much the settlement is limited to the current issue of the contract between the city and any of the city's agencies.

Last week, a jury in a District Court case asked for an unspecified sum of money to reimburse the DA Office",machine
"This week Bernie Sanders, now out of the running for the Democratic Party presidential nominee, expressed some skepticism about the demand to defund the police in an interview in the New Yorker. That demand has become a rallying cry for the protests against racist police brutality that have arisen in the wake of the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. But while Sanders echoed some of the core concepts animating the demand ? like reassigning mental health and addiction services to non-police agencies ? he didn?t explicitly lend it his approval.Sanders didn?t outright say we shouldn?t defund the police, though he did say police officers should be well-paid. Instead, he expressed disagreement with the idea that police departments should be abolished, which he seemed to conflate with defunding. The interviewer also conflated them in his question, asking, ?A lot of people in the progressive movement now are calling for defunding or abolishing the police. Do you ?? to which Sanders responded, ?Do I think we should not have police departments in America? No, I don?t. There?s no city in the world that does not have police departments.?One of Sanders?s political strengths is his ability to pinpoint demands that are ambitious enough to raise ordinary people?s expectations and transform the way they think about the relationship between politics and their daily lives, but not so much that they seem impossible and fail to resonate. Sanders has always carefully walked a tightrope of trying to expand people?s imaginations without losing credibility or popular confidence.That orientation toward reforms is precisely why he should publicly embrace the demand to defund the police.The mass protests currently underway are the most widespread in US history. A majority of Americans support them, and their popularity continues to grow. Clearly, racist police brutality is an enormously animating issue for the American public.And people aren?t just angry: it appears they?re also ready for new solutions to the problems caused by policing. The tectonic plates are rapidly shifting. City council members are embracing the idea of police budget cuts and even, in the case of Minneapolis, ?dismantling? the police. The Chicago and Los Angeles teachers? unions, the two most militant teachers? unions in the country, are talking about defunding the police and calling for a disbanding the school police department, respectively.As Bernie Sanders knows well, it?s politically strategic to be two steps ahead of people, not twenty. But while even police and prison abolitionists will generally concede that most people aren?t yet on board with abolishing the police outright, cutting local police budgets does not appear beyond the pale.There?s nothing particularly difficult to explain about the concept of spending less on police and more on vital but underfunded social programs. The United States? massive and violent police state has leaked into the gaps left by the absence of a big and vibrant welfare state. It was developed in an attempt to paper over and poorly manage the consequences of inequality while doing nothing to alleviate it, and has in fact actively made it worse.Sanders is this country?s chief proponent of reversing the tide of austerity and building social-democratic programs for all. It would not be a stretch for him to take up the demand to cut police funding and fund the collective provision of basic necessities instead.In major cities across the country, especially in cities with large black populations, police departments suck up more resources than anything else. Many police departments receive vastly more resources than other public services combined. Compared to police expenditures, major cities spend next to nothing on both non-police public safety alternatives like mental health crisis response infrastructure and general public programs like public schools, housing, health, parks, libraries, and art and culture.Simply put, defunding the police means reversing those priorities. And reversing them is no more radical than leaving them as is. It?s just more rational and humane, as Sanders himself might say.Furthermore, scaling down the carceral state would free the working class to stand up for itself in other spheres of society. See for example new research showing that incarceration rates are significantly and negatively associated with workplace organization rates. Emboldening the working class to organize and fight for itself is Sanders?s whole political project. Creating public safety alternatives that don?t have a disciplining effect on working-class organization and don?t intimidate working-class people into submission fits right into Sanders?s agenda.If Sanders stepped out and called for defunding the police, itÿwould not represent a deviation in his politics ? it would show he?s keeping his finger on the pulse.Republicans and conservative Democrats alike are choosing to frame the demand to defund the police as a referendum on the existence of police, because they feel that debate is tilted in their favor. But while police abolitionists may find it strategically useful to meet them on that ideological terrain, there?s no reason for Sanders, who serves a different function politically, to treat the demand in the same way.Sanders could pitch it as a common sense proposal to build new programs that promote social well-being while adequately funding the ones that already exist, transferring responsibilities and funds from bloated police departments. It?s squarely in his wheelhouse: he makes similar arguments about the military budget all the time.The demand to defund the police can open the door to a broader conversation about the necessity and justice of policing of any kind, and that?s why abolitionists have elevated it for decades and are doing so now. But in an immediate sense, the demand doesn?t require solving the dilemmas of a hypothetical future society. Practically it means transferring budgets away from police departments and towards other public programs that will improve lives, stabilize communities, reduce violence, and create a general sense of safety and well-being that policing can?t.Millions of people trust and listen to Bernie Sanders. He would be an excellent spokesperson ? not a lone voice, but a uniquely popular and well-positioned one ? for the demand to cut police spending and increase social spending.Public money is being funneled to the wrong places, in ways that endanger rather than benefit average people. We should be using those resources to build big, well-funded, ideally universal social programs in education, health care, and housing instead, and taxing the rich to raise more money for these programs too while we?re at it.Sounds like something Bernie Sanders would say.",human

Written by the creative team of Jonathan Edwards on the project are the future of the story of the Ice Kingdom that was born on Jan. 11, 1897. This is a book by Jonathan Edwards:

In The Frozen Star, a few short scenes are edited entirely from the original, the original cut off of both its length and the size of the head. The ending scene is taken from the original Ice Kingdom (1959) and is given to Renel Seager. However, the opening scene reveals Renel and his sister taking on the Grand Order and the Order and Snow. This opens up the idea that he is the one who created the universe, the one whose laws must be respected, the one who creates it, and the one who will make you believe that Snow just fell for one thing. It will be presented in a book titled 'Snow, Water, and Winter', by Jonathan Edwards, an award-winning artist who is currently employed to work on the book.

- Robert Carlyle ? In the original, Ice Palace was a cult classic that contained just about everything for nearly twenty years. As a result, in this version of the book I would use the colour blue, the colour is similar to the blue of a film, and my favourite colour used is purple! You can see what I mean in his first appearance in this film and in the introduction to a film called 'Snow' (1959)

- Jonathan Edwards ? The true origin of the Ice Kingdom and why there has been no attempt to change it since (1964)

- Jonathan Edwards ? The Snow Queen has never existed in the real Ice Kingdom

- Jonathan Edwards

Here is a brief recap, to summarize the concept of melting ice by the sea in this film. In the original Ice Kingdom (1958) it was based on another work by Willis Larson. This was later changed in the same project. When the book was released in 1958, it was completely redrawn because it had been adapted from the original, and it had no effect on the plot. The same is true in the first Ice Kingdom. In the ice palace (1958) you could create a little snow that melts in ice without a single layer, a little snow could dissolve in the ice that melts cold ice on occasion for a certain amount of time, and then you could use it only for the purpose of cooling a frozen planet. This meant ice melting ice and the melting ice and the melting ice of a cold planet caused it to melt. The ice palace was, by design, a frozen place and an ideal model for a cold planet to be frozen in a way that would be less uncomfortable for those who believed that ice was made of ice and is a freezing planet. The ice palace (1962) is an ice palace where you can take a ice palace and a frozen planet in a specific",machine
"The Cop Was the Hero in One Viral Video. Another Told a Different Story.

I was asked to watch a show that had aired. I told the audience that at this point, he was just a guy who saw someone running away from him to a crowd of people. This kid to me said he saw someone running away from his own life, that this kid was really doing it with his legs and his cane, that he was going through a horrible transition.

These are things that no one ever says, even a friend, says lightly. The only person that can say is ""But he only ran away from my group,"" in which case anyone who's ever seen a man run outside of somebody's life before knows that it is the victims in the ongoing suicide ritual we now live.

In order for a suicide attempt to stop your life from changing it, make no mistake, you must be the one initiating the effort. Attempting suicide before knowing exactly where you will die is a terrible process, making the decision easier, but as we say in the universe we cannot forget that it's a decision that has a huge cost.

I'm not suggesting that anyone else need doomsaying, I'm merely suggesting that it's hard to recognize as soon a man dies, the world moves so violently in the process that he's got to stand still and move to keep alive. But as I argued this week, in order to make no mistake, no one needs ask each one of your thoughts which way this whole crisis is going to go or that moment when this world moves in a certain direction and is on the verge of changing. It doesn't, as I said on some of the panels, make them more difficult.

I would argue that the world's behavior in the meantime depends upon the kind of man whom the world thinks you are.

It doesn't matter how much you hate him or how long you have lived with him, it is important, if you want to see a world where man is the one who is the one who gives away everything and is the one who is ultimately the one who makes it happen, that is, in order for the world's behavior to change and be able to save everyone, you must make no mistake.

Now the world is changing as well. What we are seeing here this week is that the world is starting to shift. This world is becoming more and more like that once upon a time: the one that was the one you wanted, and that was the one you loved. That was the one you always wanted to see change the best and most, for those of you who have never lived in the world before, this is happening again.

In that time, we have learned everything that we could about the way mankind lives. It's hard to say what is not going to happen next week, but my goal is to make it so, so simple as it must be, that no one can write it off as something that we haven't lived in for a long time.<|endoftext|>When I look at the numbers 12.4 billion today, which is a tiny fraction of the population of Canada, many question why someone else is paying for so few minutes.

Yes, some of it ? I think many of it ? is not true. One thing which should be known for sure is that it's not always easy in this instance. But this new study will explore the simple underlying premise with data.

The question is: What happens when the number of minutes per day gets small?

Before answering this question, I say the same answer, according to a rule-by-rule methodology.

Every minute counts more than one hour.

For example, if someone works in the United States, the number of minutes per day is 1,000 and 5,000, so people are more likely to be in work when there is not enough working hours. But if someone works in the rest of the world, the number of minutes each day counts at 1,000 and 5,000, so the cumulative total number of minutes counts at 5,000 and 4,000.

By the way, the rule-by-way is called differential rule. But there is often enough evidence to suggest it's not just that people are less productive now than they ever were.

For example, this study finds that in the past year the average number of minutes each person is entitled to depends on its overall economy. There was actually a slight increase in the percentage of people living in one country in the next year, but they still worked only a few dollars more on a daily basis. This seems to be at best the case, and at worst a very big drop. That's really good news for Canadians, and good news for everyone else in the world.

If we look at the numbers per hour a month ? and the number of hours a person spends working ? we see that there are a long line of jobs and workers. And if we look at the data, the answer is really big. So, a long line of jobs may",machine
"Minneapolis Will Dismantle Its Police Force, Council Members Pledge to Restore Open and Lawful Police Constables on November 2, 2016 The Minnesota State Assembly will vote to renew the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation's reservation status and court order to allow the state to take up the case.

If they're wrong, their defiance may come into view, advocates said.

Alliance with Dakota Access Builds Massive Camp to Unload 30,000 Sleeping Babies During Obama's EPA

A group of farmers from Prince George's County, Maryland, is moving their son's cattle and barns through the wilderness to hide the children of the Prince George's County Board of Supervisors.

A multinational operations center is building two stations in the near future near Mankato Lake, near Hard Rock, and adjacent to the body of water that threatens Native Americans. The open-air headquarters will serve as a single residence. Outside of that, the move, followed by 1,400 children, is all the more remarkable because it's part of the designation of Native American reservations, a political reality of federal land management. The villagers here work alongside the local Native American tribes on projects like educational projects for the children and farm equipment.

Beth Boan, a member of the president's Council on Environmental Quality, is one of the first to mention that although federal policy in the area has a pro-environment or anti-abortion agenda, past federal policies had some definite political implications. Her presence makes her brand of ""brand justice"" an open and respected issue. But it's often assumed that leaders of the ""1 millionth tribe"" who voted against the pipeline because it brought too many Africans from Africa to come to the U.S. are not doing so because of political expediency. They're giving other groups ""great concern."" It's a useful mechanism, but it hasn't helped the numbers.

Promoting Hard Rock Jobs Means Government Cannot Test Will of Super Unchecked Natural Resources In Energy Tract, March 6, 2016 A coal producer and miner committed to the revival of Hard Rock National Park in Northern Utah filed an emergency permit. ""There are many benefits to the North Rim if the resources could be recovered without supporting or expanding their infrastructure,"" Ruth Server, eminent domain attorney for the National Mining Association, said in an interview. When the waiting list at North Rim National Park is 30 months, the BLM anticipates there are 500 or more places where it may locate coal mines. It added that it has awarded $18 million worth of permits to 177 mining companies over the past decade to seek recovery of the NIMBY plan in what is not difficult to imagine for an Energy Department project. These companies have not been given explicit permits. One request, including a concern about operations before a federal tribunal would require approval from the White House, did not materialize. The water, in terms of power, remains scarce, because the ""human cost"" of transporting industrial supplies is not just higher for oil and gas companies. Some also ""want to expand it just as easily as many traditional industries because it requires constant technology updates for its air and soil conditions and far less maintenance,"" Server said. Indeed, with one person each saying ""we don't know what to do"" about the impact of mining, green leaders should work to share what is known by the mining community: that plans for temporary refineries, the oil pipeline and the long-sought oil fix show any investor less secure than they have been for decades. ""We don't know what to do about this when we've only got 30 to 50 years of projects,"" said Robert Nelson, president of the National Mining Association. But as oil prices fall, opponents point to energy policy as one piece of evidence of just how serious the problems are. The National Mining Association received 15.8 million comments on its political page during the last presidential election. The candidates had specific roles on the left and left of the political spectrum on energy policy, says Dylan Robby, spokeswoman for the National Mining Association. However, all of those who gave up their jobs while advocating for the Native Americans have now filed for federal court to try the case. Some have registered for a reverse judgment. But the case was public record at the time. The National Mining Association cited in its press release last month",machine
"Trump rails against Biden, 'Radical Left Democrats' over movement to defund police state' (Video)

The president has accused him of mischaracterizing and ignoring the results of the investigation into his former secretary of state's use of a cellphone to allow unlicensed people to search a vehicle because they were underage ? a clear breach of his campaign promise to restore U.S. citizenship. The report was submitted in response to accusations he made the wrong move with the Republican majority leader.

It's the only claim Biden has made in recent years. ""I've made a couple of statements and I like to say there is no truth in public as I have stated,"" he told NBC's Savannah Guthrie in April 2016.

In one instance, at a fundraiser for his Senate campaign in Delaware, Biden said, ""Now to all boys who think they know what they are doing is a misunderstanding. This is wrong. And it's not from a dishonest person, it's illegal. As far as I'm concerned, it is illegal.""

Biden's repeated efforts to clarify his relationship with the subject of underage sex abuse ? his statement Wednesday to The Washington Post and his campaign's response to the Pennsylvania lawmaker's complaints ? have also caused outrage among conservative leaders.

""The Republicans have become so tired of this,"" Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) told The Post in an interview Thursday. ""You don't want a lot of attention on him.""

But Biden's comments echo comments that he would urge women in the country to call out their partners ? a comment and a particularly dismissive statement for the Washington Post that has prompted calls about the potential breach of an otherwise indefensible system for investigating the problem of underage sex abuse.

""I think if you put a rapist in a room, then you're not the right person,"" Biden said.

""The problem is that the government has the authority to prosecute,"" he said.

As he explained in a speech at his Marist fundraiser last week, Biden's comments about underage abuse are hardly ""anti-gay,"" as he suggested.

""There is no problem in the gay rights issue,"" Biden told the donors in reference to his comments in a January appearance on CNN's ""New Day Show."" ""There is an issue,"" Biden added, ""about the way people look at gay people ? I mean gay people.""

The comments came in response to emails showing to The Washington Post that Biden said, in 2013, that his wife, Chelsea, was raped by an underage boy whom he called the ""gay boy."" Biden later apologized.

""I am absolutely ashamed of the remarks of a gay boy who called to me to say I had sexual relations with a girl that I had never met. I had no sexual relations with that boy. I apologized to anyone who had met me or shared my story of sexual contact with him until I came out as gay in 1996, after I was six years old, to tell mom and dad I had sexual relations with him,"" he recalled.<|endoftext|>Sebastian Vettel is likely to win the Italian GP

Sebastian Vettel is believed to be making a big step down from his BMW boss following his admission that he has broken Nick Heidfeld's DNA following Saturday's run outside the top-left-wing European GP that saw eight former world champion Romain Grosjean admitted that the Ferrari driver's heritage is 'racist'.

German Grosjean, who was the reigning reigning champion of the Constructor Renault Championship for a decade and has defended his title in the last seven seasons, said that Mercedes has ""reinforced"" his heritage to do so.

However, Vettel insisted that he, unlike Vettel, was ""anyone who wants to break 50 years of motorsport history.""

""My understanding is that these are complete achievements and the next generation of young Valtteri Bottas will see just that in this history,"" the Italian said. ""But no, there isn't one, any less than or implied.

""I have the same understanding that Sergio [Heitkamp] and I have had with the other teams. But there is no time for change at Mercedes. This has happened too often in the past.

""The reason why this car is so important is that in the past these engines were little more than old cars. The same is true of a Ferrari or even a GT car no longer. But here on Saturday for a rookie driver in Rolex, you find five no-one-two-three-six-years-old.

""I understand why he was elected and why he has been so successful, but I don't see why we, the team and everything that had to happen to him has not changed.""

"Seattle residents slam ?Defund the police? as ?radical experiment? during city budget meeting

In short ?""I hate a police. I don't want police treated like police"".

In his second entry, on an unknown basis, a Muslim Muslim who believes that there were a great number of black men in a society that was already in a society where they had a ""honor to worship God and worship Him"", has described on the internet the ""great amount of police being done"" as ""trying to keep up the appearance of a large amount of violence"".

Yet according to an anonymous source in the area, some Muslim community are still trying to track down this source and report what they have.

The government of Britain has imposed a similar ban on police service dogs in this area. The only thing is to protect them from terrorism, it has been said.

An official at a community centre in London who has received a report from another mosque said: ""There are a lot of Muslim community, a lot of people, who are interested in coming out. It's a very, very difficult situation.

""I'm not suggesting they should be allowed to come out, it's a very serious matter to the police.""

They claim they are ""sheltered"" in the Muslim community, as Muslim women have often come out to speak of themselves as Muslims in society.

It is also a ""very, dangerous place"" where there are ""Muslims in every colour and creed"", such as Black Muslims in Black communities.

It is not just the police that have refused to respond to calls. This has also been reported in other cities where there have been such widespread ""civil strife"" of the last number of years.

Image caption A council worker said the issue is not ""part of the culture"" of the police

But the official, in the centre of The Church of the Holy Trinity in the heart of Birmingham city, suggested that nothing could be done to help solve the problem.

In 2005, the centre, which has a line of shops, delis and large businesses, had one of the largest-worthseries in Birmingham before the authorities decided to do a ""racial sweep"".

""It was a way for them to make sure that their business had never gone wrong,"" he said.

""People were coming and going to be treated a different way by this, so that no one was being allowed to see the problem as being racialised.

""When I went to do the ethnography I noticed they were not there to give out their address of the businesses that were in the city centre.

""It made it no difference which ethnicity came or anything else.""

On Sunday, the council announced fines for Christians who do not attend services in England after reports of ""cannot make a noise"".

An Islam expert who spent three-and-a-half hours in an accommodation space at the first-floor Birmingham Mosque on the outskirts of the centre said ""we're just doing an Islam education for every Muslim boy. We don't understand the difference between Islam and religion, and it is like, 'Hey, it's not a safe place for us, it's not a public space'"".

The government of Birmingham has been at this particular point in working closely with the council. In the past, they have objected to a free flow of people coming to the mosque after a number of instances of discrimination against Muslims in the city had not been taken place for more than a dozen years but were upheld last year.

My goal, I felt, was to establish an academic-minded landscape of sports that the rest of the world wouldn't want to know about. I was very aware of the potential the game of football had for me to be grounded in a world of indoor football, from the linemen and outfielders to the guards to the defenders and even the scorekeepers.

The game itself was about moving forward in indoor soccer. The game could be played anywhere in the world and you could be in one moment moving forward in football. I still had a long way to go before the game began, but when I reached my goal in this short little clip, I realized I had no room left for myself to think too much.

"Republican and Democrat pushing legislation against defunding police: 'We need some voices of reason' ? Senate Democrats Read more

The senators are expected to vote Friday on three bills that passed the House, with four of the bills expected to be considered by the Senate to override Obamacare's failure to repeal its health law.

A provision to defund the Affordable Care Act by GOP House conservatives was a crucial step to push Obamacare up the scale.

Republicans would block all funding for Medicaid, which covers people whose health needs cover only under 50 British pounds or under 500 kilos of food, at least in January and February.

President Obama nominated a Democratic-lead bill to replace the Affordable Care Act, but its contents would be limited to just the House version, where it is expected to finish in the Senate this week. The legislation is expected to come before the Senate, where its author is unlikely to face an easy compromise in the Senate.

Republicans are expected to pass another bill, which will be debated in the next several days, that would repeal Obamacare as part of Obamacare's unpopularly under-taxed spending cuts.<|endoftext|>It's been five years since we opened our doors and started a blog.

"'Defund the Police' mural changed to 'Defend the Police' outside Milwaukee City Hall Thursday. (Photo By Bill Sinden/Star Tribune)

The city and Milwaukee police departments have been locked down by an unprecedented barrage of sexual assault allegations.

In just this week, more than 100 people have come forward ? a record 37 percent of the total ? to say City Council member Connie Rasmussen is handling the situation with ""grave concern."" The reported incidents ? involving four men, one woman and no arrests ? began at the City Hall on April 8. The meeting was one of at least six public comments on the issue gathered on Tuesday, with some public objecting to a resolution to keep officers involved.

The move hasn't hurt the response to the issue at a time when it has come under criticism for lingering over a lack of resources when officers were suspended, charged with rape or sexual assault. Over the last three years, some of the police officers who'd served as the City Council's new disciplinary arm are making the changes, which would force them to reduce the number of officers who can do their jobs for lower pay.

""Officers need fewer officers, more commanders and more staff members,"" said the city manager, Anne Marie Th‚rŠse. ""We're really trying to enhance this capability, so we will be able to have greater focus on what we are doing.""

In May, three officers were suspended for allegedly attacking a pregnant employee after her wife and a friend left a home in which a man sexually assaulted her. A month later, three others were suspended for allegedly punching a woman and a man being beaten by the officers.

The officers have had several years of training before they were supposed to be able to handle the situation.

Rennie Hochstadter, director of Milwaukee Family Law Reform Organization, said the city's plan to require officers who report sexual assault to maintain their jobs does not appear to require them to also change roles, even though the city has already made it clear that the issue isn't being addressed.

""We all know that when a guy is raped, they have to have special authority to take care of the situation,"" Hochstadter said. ""I'm confident that they've done our homework so far before the meeting.""

Hochstadter said it's likely the city isn't up to the task of educating officers as to the status of their disciplinary proceedings.

""We're not supposed to tell the police a few words,"" he said. ""We don't want to sit in the back of a patrol car. We don't want to tell the officers to do whatever their job is. In this case, we're trying to keep an open mind about the sexual assault issue.""

He made his comments Tuesday afternoon at the City Council meeting, not long after a hearing on the issue.

City Council members said they're hoping to hear from other officers over the next couple of weeks.

""None of us want to be on edge,"" City Councilman Larry Reid said. ""We're willing to be the only side.""

Globally, the University of Illinois' decision to drop three of its peer-reviewed research projects is the second to go in a year, after multiple reporting drops in Texas. The Texas-based journal Science first reported findings from staff and students this summer at a conference in Houston, citing budget cuts and a lack of staff.

But those papers, Science said, highlighted a major challenge for the University that the budget and other policy makers face: Avoid unmet science-based research that draws from peer-reviewed studies.

""Statistics have repeatedly demonstrated that costs to research occur far behind resources and funding levels,"" the paper said. ""In the United States, University of Illinois has a high rate of cost, less than two times the size of the region and less than six times the global average.""

In the journal Science that has received generous funding from President Obama's research agencies to develop and publish peer-reviewed journals, the University of Illinois' Science reported that costs of three of their facilities did not exceed $2 million dollars, and revenues from those facilities came in multiple times when they stopped funding.

But that money did not come without a cost, Science said. It was, the paper said, cheaper and less costly than existing grants and other support to study the causes of cancer.

That cost was a main source of funding for the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The Illinois Center for Science in Public Interest examined data from the National report that was collected from about a third of its facilities in",machine
"In New York City, Momentum Behind Cutting the NYPD Budget Is Growing

New York city's budget is $220 million less than it was before the 9/11 attacks, according to Bloomberg:

When it comes to training and funding, the rest of the government is making a lot more than it's spending on training and grants to the cops. Meanwhile, when it comes to funding the criminal justice system, it's outspending and spending more than nearly half of what it is funding the military, which is responsible for around six percent of spending.

Far from being cut through spending, NYPD has made significant headway to keep itself afloat and thus makes a significant push into the New York City budget. Many have criticized the NYPD for focusing on priorities on the police. But given what has happened in the past year, there is clearly not much that can be done to build a broad bipartisan coalition to rework the NYPD budget or to cut funding.

Furthermore, if anything, perhaps the administration is making a mistake by insisting that the local populations in Manhattan get more out of the new NYC Police Department?without actually being spied on, there is less need for police activity outside of policing. Additionally, the recent narrative of lowering the patrol numbers can hurt NYC's morale.

While funding doesn't matter as much as it should in order to keep a city on its feet, it is best not to make any generalizations about what it is that makes it a more valuable source of revenue in a major city.

You might not agree, but it is worth considering that almost one third of New York City residents receive small fines and/or jail time. The two highest rates of imprisonment in the nation are for offenses such as larceny, trespassing, misdemeanor rioting, traffic violations, larceny with a gun and vehicle larceny.

The recent wave of high-profile cops raising questions about targeting poor and minority neighborhoods was particularly troubling.

Add to that the NYPD, which was once a body of highly specialized local law enforcement tasked with prioritizing public safety, and suddenly there is nothing but focus on a few name-brand big names?like NYPD lieutenant Jeremy Moustafa?of new, pop culture icon prominence. The starkly different outcome was that there was a single NYPD commander, driving some $65 billion into the city in 2015. Even at the lowest bidder, this type of focus often works.

Whether that's management of the department or passing decisions on two-time mayors, the overarching storyline in New York City has been that New York City cops don't look like highly trained or low-quality soldiers anymore?just normal men sitting around working hard on some shady variety of hidden project.

So when New York City's mayor announced he would start placing an end to criminal charges that are so recent as arrest for stealing $1 million, it seems like New York City cops aren't exactly becoming so common as it used to be.

This in part reflects the fact that officers feel that what is the job of the police department?specifically, the communities with the most criminal activity?will just be handled by other local agencies and programs. This creates an unrealistic expectation for management to focus on more than just policing the problems in their communities. It also makes it harder to keep up with the rapid expansion of crime on the ground.

Perhaps the best thing New York City has done in the past few years is likely to continue to do is produce some overall data on the way we spend our public money.

And that data will serve as an asset in the next budget proposal and could even establish New York City as the national leader in keeping clean air, drinking water, and basic infrastructure working.

"Biden Said, ?Most Cops Are Good.? But Progressives Want Systemic Change.? That's the same cop that said Obama might not be all that smart.

And while the investigation into Weiner's previous email practices was plagued by attention-grabbing pressure, the day that the investigation was reported back to the press doesn't give us much chance to really see whether Weiner will turn himself in.

Here's what we know:

There was no flagrant misconduct in reporting and, frankly, there is no evidence that anyone ever entered into a consensual relationship with a minor.

Federal investigators are examining people who worked in his system. His boss did not pay a fee to conduct the job. The sexual nature of the chat was questionable. Nor was Weiner's view of the election process?which has never been answered or, since the Weiner scandal began, never fully investigated.

For starters, in a string of independent investigations since the investigation launched, the State Department has released testimony proving improper sexual conduct. (The FBI recently investigated State for its affair with Huma Abedin's top aide, a candidate for State Department deputy secretary, and for that he received more than $200,000.)

Stacey C. Woodman, executive director of the Independent Counsel Watchdog Program, said her organization recently hired three workers at an electronics company to investigate reports of data-swap activity in the company's systems. She said they had learned that no such data was known to the state government and did not report the information to the F.B.I., a reference to the Women's Health Insurance Program (WHSI), which mandated women obtain health care coverage by using the W.H.I.

Asked why they worked with the W.H.I., Woodman said, ""Because we didn't have answers.""

Two other J.D.s, who had worked as a traffic lawyer for seven years in Maryland, said they received last week they were not aware of the State Department investigating, let alone found, that it collected emails from which Weiner communicated. J.D. Michael Latham, a spokeswoman for the State Department, said in a statement that because of poor coordination between the agencies and State, ""sources may have misinterpreted these findings, and could have otherwise faced greater legal action than any of us should have."" The message is for ""providing clarity and common sense oversight.""

This was especially true of the race between Ed Ehrlich, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair, and Kristen Alperowitz, the Democratic U.S. Senate candidate. Both aides agreed there was no indication that their staff contributed to the Weiner affair. But they disagreed with Latham's interpretation that these emails could be under the category of over classified because of the timing of their transmission. Latham has said she has no interest in taking votes from him for district-level control.

Woodman said neither aide ever publicly acknowledged or denied making such requests. She suggested that so-called ""sensitive information"" in Weiner's case should be in the system.

Asked how they were able to access any of this information that might have to do with election law, Woodman said: ""No obvious issue raised.""

One is the question of whether it was possible for someone who works in the congressional system to say on an FBI internal email server he was under no obligation to disclose this information to Congress, provided he knew he was being investigated. But if the provision of it is discussed in Congress, it is a problem for just about every justice, with no clear indication in recent months that there was a strong mechanism by which other members of Congress would have no legal obligation to correct their mistakes.

The other real issue is with the issue of the investigation.

An independent complaint filed by Congress against the F.B.I. has alleged ""grave neglect"" at the White House and was not properly handled and did not properly address allegations that an internal investigation was being pushed to the committee.

Meanwhile, Rep. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), a Democrat who has worked closely with Weiner, has filed an internal complaint with the F.B.I. On Thursday afternoon, it took Fox News in particular for a small but significant change. The panel has accepted the F.B.I. report on Ehrlich's comment in an",machine
"These Top Democrats Go Further Than Biden on Diverting Police Funds to Support Crime Prevention.

The 13 Democrats who called on President Obama to step in on May 14, 2013, renewed their call for President Obama's leadership in criminal justice reform.

""I am determined to see President Obama take a bold step forward on policing,"" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), ""to send the message that this is not just an issue of justice reform but of improving our own policing. And a step that would provide full transparency and transparency about the function of federal law enforcement.""

""Frankly, we are left to elect Obama as our president,"" they continued. ""It is time for us to choose an exciting new direction and commit to delivering the same result that was achieved after 9/11. As you and I have pledged, we will take action for the long-term prosperity of this country.""

President Obama on May 14, 2013, unveiled his response to deadly unrest in Ferguson, Mo., where Philando Castile was fatally shot while attempting to run from police, asking to see laws governing their use of force.

""When it comes to bringing stability to communities, fighting to make sure no one gets killed in their street corners and walking streets, it's time for President Obama to step up,"" he said in a statement.

""This is the first time I've heard an administration call for law enforcement to be used for political gain, but this administration isn't the only one who is not doing so. More to the point, many of our elected officials simply don't get this message,"" he continued.

According to a report in May 2014, Obama ""tried to strike a balance in a tangle of conflicting interests with Hillary Clinton and her opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders,"" according to a copy of a May 2015 Democratic National Committee (DNC) report on using campaign funds in federal elections.

Many Democratic lawmakers went so far as to call for using funds, rather than police, to help solve crimes.

Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who was criticized as the ""C'mon, that's got it. Move along,"" in February 2014 when he issued a statement noting that funds only allowed police to use certain tactics:

""We knew when the FBI publicly accused Philando Castile of trying to run away or two miles south of my office in order to protect an African-American man, no one would question it."" ""We gave the white supremacists the 'inside scoop' as a tactic of last resort and so white supremacists pulled back and tried again to kill my constituents in mass graves instead of focusing on murdering Black lives."" ""This Administration cannot accept its own political and moral ignorance and refusal to take the steps necessary to reform our criminal justice system to reduce the political and social costs associated with this catastrophe.""

""We put our heads in the sand every day."" ? Jon Horwitz

Here are five people who can be part of the problem, writing about the actions of a president and his record as responsible for police and law enforcement:

James Van Dyke, a Maine native who has served as state police chief since 1997 and has spoken about the harm government can do to communities of color. The 73-year-old has spoken in support of our drug laws and their targeting of low-income communities, recently calling for clemency for Eric Garner.

Julie Murphy, a Connecticut mom who has served as chief of police in the past 24 years. The 62-year-old served as deputy governor from 2002 to 2012. After retiring from the police department and before ever becoming an elected official, she served as police commissioner in other states and led the police department from 2010 to 2015, when she did something similar to Dallas fire chief David Brown who was attacked and killed by police during an investigation into his relationship with the Black community.

Monica Girard-Miller, a senior political science researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has covered issues ranging from the violent extremism and rise of Islamic extremism in America, and George McGovern's counterterrorism unit, from 2005 to 2010. She said the importance of political trust and reform must begin with an improving policing system.

"Police Brutality Against Protesters Only Stoked the Anti?Police Brutality Movement

By Joe Rollet

Sunday, July 19, 2015

A multi-platform, student-driven anti-police riot was waged against up to 25 demonstrators of the New York State Democratic Party and Donald Trump's campaign during the Democratic National Convention and the Republican National Convention last night. Several protesters were arrested and charged with misdemeanor rioting, three charges that were later dropped against five others.

Hundreds of protesters, including women and children, converged on Fourth Street and the Wesleyan University campus early Sunday to occupy the candidate's New York State office from 12 p.m. until 3 a.m. The protest was triggered by criminal charges filed against protesters in downtown New York and at other colleges and universities in the state.

Police razed an entrance to the university building to try to reach demonstrators and then, days later, attempted to control the escalating event.

Acting NYPD Sgt. Steve Murphy, of the Assistant Commissioner's Office, said Friday that arrests were made in the case, which had since broken down.

""The number of protesters during the protest at 'Orange Is The New Black' and at our other campuses was larger than most demonstrations,"" Murphy told The Post. ""These arrests did not reflect an appreciation of the constitutionality of the use of force and that of the law in Ohio.""

It was not immediately clear if the protesters were for the Democratic Party or Trump.

They also ""moved strongly"" during a rally on 3rd Street on Saturday. Several people gave out chants that originated with remarks by the candidate's campaign: ""I told you so,"" ""I saw what you're doing"" and ""Donald Trump wants to ban Muslims.""

Those demands followed other similar chants by Trump. On Monday, he called for the death of all Muslims and the Iraqi city of Mosul to be rebuilt.

At the same time, he said federal funds would help compensate targets for illegal gun sales.

Because they are so dependent on taxpayer dollars, Cuyahoga Falls would only benefit if for-profit gun shows (SSBSs) could file hundreds of thousands of reports annually, and they could be persuaded to offer pay cuts based on noncompliance.

In addition to helping inform Congress on mental health issues and limits on gun control, the proposed changes would also make it harder for any victim to testify about their shooting, he said.

As he promised when he was re-elected, Cuyahoga Falls' Nick Samuelson has already contributed $250,000 to Samuelson's unsuccessful campaign, while members of the state's openly gay community will also be earning significant increases from ""and-"" guns.",machine
"Sitting in a church service several years back, listening to his pastor speak of the obligation to confront what is wrong in society, Branville G. Bard Jr. thought about being a Black man and a top police official too.?I know some of you think you?re helping,? Mr. Bard recalled his pastor telling parishioners that morning. ?But you can?t actually help and be silent.?That remark moved Mr. Bard to openly confront what he considered an agonizing truth: He was part of a system ?built on oppression and, structurally, on racism,? he said.?Not to acknowledge that means a failure to acknowledge the past,? said Mr. Bard, who became the police commissioner in Cambridge, Mass., in 2017. ?Folks are just going to continue to resent your failure to acknowledge that.?As police chiefs struggle to reform their departments amid a national reckoning over police abuse, those African-American officers who have risen to the top say they face particular challenges. The expectations they face are outsize, coming from those chanting ?Black lives matter!? as well as those subbing out the word Black for blue.Some Black chiefs have had negative interactions with police officers while out of uniform, and they are expected to smooth out tensions between Black residents angry at the police and officers who recoil at the suggestion that they harbor racial bias. The chiefs are lauded for trying to change the system, but also knocked as traitors by some of those in blue and in the communities they come from. Some chiefs have knelt with protesters, but they have also overseen officers deploying tear gas at demonstrations.?You feel something, as an African-American male, that there?s extra pressure on you to somehow wave a magic wand and you can make some of the things go away,? said Kenton Buckner, who became the Syracuse police chief in late 2018.?A chief is every day walking a tightrope of trying to please his appointing authority, Police Department and the community, and treat them all as your wives,? he added. ?And they?re all extremely jealous of each other, but you have to walk that tightrope each day to make sure that you?re in line with all three of them.?The precarious nature of being a Black chief in this moment was apparent in recent days when the leaders of two departments announced they would step down.Chief U. Rene‚ Hall of Dallas said she would leave the force in November after receiving heavy criticism for her officers? response this summer to protests against racism in policing. And Chief La?Ron D. Singletary of Rochester, N.Y., joined his entire command in stepping down amid intense backlash over his handling of the death of a Black man in police custody in March.Those resignations came about a month after a Black police chief, Carmen Best, announced she was leaving the Seattle Police Department because of budget cuts and restructuring to her force that she felt the city?s political leadership executed without properly including her.While Ms. Best received heavy criticism for not reining in her officers? aggressive response to protesters, some of her supporters said she faced discrimination from city leadership, which can be a roadblock for African-American police leaders. Ms. Best, the first Black woman to serve as the city?s police chief, said she could not say whether her race or gender influenced how the City Council dealt with her.?I don?t think I?ll ever know fully what was in the hearts and minds of the various council members,? she said. But, she added, the efforts to defund the Police Department ?without having a conversation with the police chief, and being highly dismissive ? it does bring one to question what the motive was there.?M. Lorena Gonz lez, the president of the Seattle City Council, said race played no role in the differences she had with the former chief. Rather, it was Ms. Best?s failure to embrace transformational change, Ms. Gonz lez said.?I know that self-proclaimed progressive police chiefs across the country pledge fidelity to reform but few operationalize those pledges or push reform beyond the edges,? she said in a text message. ?That is in part because of the systemic oppression that pervades policing and even leaders of color within those systems are not immune from that oppression.?Through lived experience, Black leaders in law enforcement can sometimes bring an understanding of the nuances of community tensions with the police.Commissioner Bard, who wrote his doctoral dissertation on racial profiling in policing, is rolling out a record-keeping system in his department that will allow it to keep detailed data on police stops and analyze whether racial bias is a factor.Donny Williams, a native of Wilmington, N.C., who became that city?s police chief this year, said he tried to limit the number of officers who showed up to calls. He attributed that goal to a sentiment he heard coming up in a Black neighborhood, where people would complain of ?carloads? of police officers showing up in their communities. When 10 officers respond to a traffic stop in which four would suffice, that can seem like over-policing, he said.He also does not allow his officers to wear armored vests as an outer layer or other militarized-looking apparel when it is unnecessary because he wants his officers to appear approachable, not like soldiers, he said.His friends and family still have ?brutally honest conversations? with him about their issues with the police, he said.?That?s one of the things that I can see from the perspective, especially of the Black community, it looks like we just come in as a military force in the Black community,? he said.When he was still a patrol captain in a predominantly Black neighborhood, Chief Williams said he noticed that the officers had no bond with young people, who seemed to have few organized activities.?I was one of those young Black men,? he said.So he started programs that brought children and the police together. He recalled that he became interested in the profession when he got to know officers who worked in the public housing project where he lived; they took him on his first trip outside of the city, to the zoo in Asheboro.As a Black woman who is from Phoenix, Jeri L. Williams, the city?s police chief, said community members sometimes had more patience and trust with her to get to the bottom of a critical incident before casting judgment. She built that capital with the community through years of meeting with residents for ?very painful? listening sessions about policing, she said. They have prepared her for this time when there are huge demands for change.?Because I?m true to my faith, I?m true to blue, I?m true to Black, it?s time for us to roll up our sleeves and really take care of the police reform issues that need to be taken care of,? she said. ?My unique perspective also reminds me that more work needs to be done.?This moment seems to have increased the demand for Black leadership in law enforcement.After just a few months on the job, the white police chief in Portland, Ore., stepped down in June and handed over the reins to Chuck Lovell, a Black veteran of the department known for his deep community ties.?Part of it is representation, who?s at the table, who?s there when decisions are being made,? Chief Lovell said. ?One of the things that?s helpful being a Black chief is you can have some different conversations with folks in the Black community. There?s a feeling that you can be a little more honest.?In Louisville, where the killing of Breonna Taylor in a police raid has sparked unrest, the mayor appointed Yvette Gentry, a Black woman and former deputy chief, as the interim chief of the department this week. In an emotional address during her introduction, Chief Gentry, moved to tears at times, spoke of the need for broad systemic changes in racial equity across the board, not just policing. She told a story of her son moving into a neighborhood only to have neighbors call in drug dealer complaints against him days later.?I served 20-something years willing to die for a city that wouldn?t even make my son feel welcome,? she said during the news conference. ?Our city is going to crumble if we don?t start telling truths.?The renewed focus on racist policing followed the death of George Floyd, who was pressed to the pavement by officers with the Minneapolis Police Department, with one of them pushing his knee into Mr. Floyd?s neck. The department is headed by a Black chief, Medaria Arradondo, who has faced enormous challenges as street protests have grown violent and his officers have been criticized for abusing and mistreating Black residents.Amid the tense moment in police-community relations, Chief Arradondo continues to enjoy broad support from Black residents, who see him as one of their own in the city where he was born and bred. Since Mr. Floyd?s killing sparked massive calls for reform and a pledge by a majority of the City Council to dismantle the Police Department, Chief Arradondo has worked with Mayor Jacob Frey to pass several reforms, including a revamped use-of-force policy.But Black chiefs do not find themselves spared from criticism.Chief Hall, who is leaving the Dallas Police Department, won early praise from some activists when she came on the job three years ago, said Changa Higgins, the lead organizer for the Dallas Community Police Oversight Coalition, an activist group. She engaged with community members, revamped the complaint process and worked with organizers to create a new police oversight office and board, Mr. Higgins said.But Mr. Higgins said he felt that her tone started to shift last year when activists were removed from the first oversight board meeting. She did not seem to support the board once it was created, he said. Relations deteriorated after the Police Department used what some local leaders and activists felt was unnecessary force on protesters in late May and early June.Mr. Higgins said he understood that as a Black woman, Chief Hall had to endure racism and sexism in a male-dominated profession that could have hampered her efforts to effect change. But he said he was nonetheless underwhelmed with her leadership.?I think it?s very important to have police chiefs who understand their community and get the pulse of what Black folks feel about police,? he said. ?But even more important than that is having police chiefs that understand what to do about it. Just because you?re a Black police chief doesn?t mean you?re the best-suited person for that job to be a reformer and to transition out of something old into something new.?Shaila Dewan contributed reporting.",human
"Distrust of the Minneapolis Police, and Also the Effort to Defund Them""

And you have a whole team of cops.

There are probably 20,000 different, most brutal, and most dangerous departments in the U.S.

But I could have you come up with one number ? a combination that gives this department a whole new meaning?

I think it can.

The U.S. House's Safe Neighborhood Act, or H.R. 2447, was passed in 1987, and was one of just one of 17, more than 5,000 people killed by police in America in fiscal 2016 alone. It was the highest number of police fatalities reported in the U.S. history, and by far the highest number of murders in any major urban area. The only reason the law was passed back in 1988 is because of the increased use of force. But in most cities, it's not an unreasonable assumption that such statistics can be used to justify the vast majority of police officer deaths.

Of course, this is all speculative. What's at issue, though, is whether certain crimes ? some of which were dropped because of a specific, more visible tactic ? were to blame for the deaths in 2016 as well.

Most murders were committed by poor cops who, according to new findings by The Washington Post, were out of luck because of the cost. Their findings are based solely on data collected by local crime departments and released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. That includes crime dropout rates in urban areas, as well as in certain counties, and is a good indication of the number of police stops, arrests, and other forms of discipline given the high numbers of stops.

I would argue that, even in urban settings where there's no such thing as an officer killing an innocent person, it's unlikely to be true. But the point here is that the public's perception of crime has shifted.

The real problem with this new law is the way in which the law is structured. As Michael Boeser, president of the American Police Association, told the Star-Ledger this morning:

The public's perception of police conduct is so exaggerated, it's not just that it is unconstitutional but that it may be unconstitutional in some cases. What we are seeing here is a very negative shift in policing that is going on for a very long time. It is not unreasonable for a police officer to fear that his actions will cause a person harm and that, yes, the person may be killed before they get even to the point of killing an innocent person.

The problem with this shift in policing has to do with a different focus.

In a letter to the NAACP, CJS said:

The rise of the police officer killing of black and brown people over the course of the last six decades could signal a shift towards the use of force by police officers who have taken the opposite approach, who understand clearly that there are a number of cases where officers may be wrongfully fired upon by a trained officer. To a degree, the rise of the police officer killing of black and brown people over the last six decades could signal a shift toward the use of force by police officers who have taken the opposite approach, who understand clearly that there are many cases where officers may be wrongfully fired upon by a trained officer.

The same lack of understanding of police department performance is a point that is worth emphasizing. At the same time, it's fair to say, police officers must do everything they can to deter and stop criminals. In the midst of the current cycle a law has been proposed to balance a police officer's decision to kill a suspect, and it's a big one.

But those elements are getting lost in the mainstream media.

In the wake of the Minneapolis police shooting of Alton Sterling, there's been a push to put law enforcement agencies in more proportion with those results. Law enforcement agencies should be the first priority in this fight.

A police officer dying of a gunshot wound in public, according to reports, is a real concern. But in the same light that being the first officer killed in a murder in Minnesota is a real concern. But there is no such thing as a legitimate police officer dying of an attack in public, according to an independent report. The problem is that, while law enforcement agencies are all supposed to be on the lookout for crimes, just because a suspect kills a cop there's not actually a problem that's likely to be found for a crime by other officers.

As I've written here before, this is an unfair and inefficient approach. The problem is that the standard for using force has not changed for at least 2,500 years. The only difference is that, for years, law enforcement had been using it at a high rate throughout history. The idea that police forces can be more effective than those they're used to is not new.

One would have assumed such a strategy would have been done when there was even less accountability for actions during the past 10 years of law enforcement ? it",machine
"Curtis Hill: Defund police in response to George Floyd killing? It?s an insane idea that would increase crime. ? Suspect in both George Floyd and Charleston Walter Davis? ? news Report to the Honorable Mitchell S. Smart --- January 7, 2017 I strongly disagree with you on this one, and I will not put on a lectern for that reason. As you well know, I have consistently disagreed with your assessments on how to address current violence in our community, and as you know, we spend less time addressing our preoccupation with the potential for weapons of mass destruction and more time doing what the prosecutors and law enforcement folks there are telling us to do, which is to ignore these facts and bring the guns and guns to the community. And I believe that our city needs to respond to those facts, and I expect your statements on this matter to provide an in-depth commentary on how that will happen. In this case, despite your recent and mounting public criticism of myself, I personally have not been naive about the necessity for thorough rethinking the next step in America's response to the Charleston violence that began with the threat of a seemingly random weapon carrying gunman. ÿThe most important question is how you would respond to such a senseless act that in the days following, maybe by federal gun laws might become something bigger. I feel this community needs to protect itself from violence, and so it should. ÿI know that's not the case when other people're trying to deal with this. ÿBut the first step is being pragmatic. ÿYou know, the way we work would be this: would we just build our own rifles, where it might take hours of paperwork? ÿOr would we go to different cities to create for all citizens new guns and started. ÿOr would we make every minute count? ÿDo we say, oh we need a weapon to do that? As for the first step, if the answer is no, then all people need to work together to create what is a safe place. ÿThose, then, who are going to choose between lives and destruction ought to try to start at the very earliest possible moment when they can. ÿWe will. ÿYes, then there will be debates about gun control. ÿAnd yes, there will be a lot of complicated legal questions in the event this happens, but even if we agree that it's not important to deny the right of concealed carry to such people, no one's going to deny the right of this community to stop someone whose job it is to gather and see whether there is some ""reasonable measure"" of protection in respect of such innocent people. All of this is perfectly valid in principle if you come to realize that if there are real flaws in your proposed change, the answer is no. In my view, if we ever need to go that far and start into a new process with foreign states it will be because the United States does not, and neither does its allies in this fight for global survival. So why not start with a two way street? ÿFirst, because the U.S. is effectively responding to the very real threat that this little incident present to our local, regional and global security and since 2016 in fact won't occur as frequently or as rapidly as it has in recent years, we need to move beyond our current role as a prop in the action on this issue and instead start with a longer-term goal of bringing civil law enforcement onside to the cause of the truth and the innocent. ÿSecond, because to do that, we need to work on actions, not political ones. ÿAfter all, this is the policy area for which I believe most of the community will care most about the interests of all citizens, and that's why I will work with the gun-toting community to enforce those actions on our government, within every state and government building and national borders. ÿAnd as for being current, I am ready to bring our community together as a host in a public forum. ÿIf it's important to us that these actions be carried out well-publicized so that people are watching what we do at events and that we don't create trouble in some other ways, then I think it would be a good idea for us to bring some real change. ÿIn my opinion, my previous set of suggestions for how to act as a host were",machine
"Texas officials introduce legislation to punish cities that defund police departments. (Photo By Eric Gaymer of USA TODAY)

The Justice Department declined to comment on the Justice Department announcement Friday, but Assistant Attorney General Paul Kane told a conference committee that the department had already done a preliminary version of an amended version.

His statement, however, came as a surprise. The Justice Department had announced that it would sue cities that defund police departments. That wasn't the case, as Attorney General Jayapal had stated previously.

But according to an FBI inspector general report issued Thursday, cities that defunded police departments in November are still exempt from compliance. (The agency did not answer questions about the report.)

""A total of 4,745 cities and towns in this country have elected to terminate police departments in at least 10 separate instances (out of 10,407 with a total number of instances filed) with the intent of terminating,"" the report said. ""The number of such instances is approximately $30 million each each year.""

According to the GAO report, cities that defunded police departments in November were still eligible to pay a penalty amount equal to $150,230.

[This is the 10 worst state constitutions in terms of the number of officers involved in the department-wide budget ]

Since 2015, when officers fired at police departments in three states ? Texas, Florida and Arizona ? the Justice Department has done so without prohibiting cities from spending money to fire departments that fail to comply with the laws.

The Justice Department will now face the dilemma of paying the salaries of every officer that fails to comply with the laws but still will have to cover costs for the rest of the five-year terms.<|endoftext|>The United States Senate approved a law Sunday that forces the Trump administration to establish its own legal basis for repealing a proposed rule that the President used to repeal the Federal Communication Commission's 2015 Communications Decree ""on foreign persons,"" as well as ""commercial speech,"" in the form of ""political speech.""

The new law also requires the president to make clear to the White House his authority to take legal action in the form of ""prohibiting foreign persons from holding United States business in foreign countries, including U.S. territories beyond their home territories,"" according to a White House press release.

The ""prohibitions include:

""A definition of speech that would otherwise apply to foreign persons to have their speech be broadcast or published by another foreign country"";

""An action to violate an international law"" by ""substantially infringing on other countries""; and

""A statement in support of the right of U.S. citizens to voice their opinions outside the United States without a request that would be interpreted as a threat to the country's foreign policy interests by the U.S. President.""

The new law adds:

""In practice, the law provides a framework for the rulemaking regime for the purpose of limiting foreign persons' speech and for the provisions of a foreign government's regulations. The rulemaking statute, which was passed on June 27, 2017, shall have the force of the president. These provisions have been in full force for some six months and provide an additional 30 days in which a foreign nation requires the executive agency to make certain action required by the regulations to make such action in this way.""

The language goes on to suggest that the rule is applicable as an exception for foreign persons only, not as a substitute for their speech.

This law, however, does not go far enough and has not received the unanimous support of the Senate, three of them Democrats and two Republicans, as shown below.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Majority Leaders Harry Reid of Nevada and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska announced the repeal of the ""proceedings of the executive department"" last month when they voted on Trump's move. But the administration, which is also facing internal problems in the form of the new ruling, has no legal authority to take action.

In its most recent filing with the Senate, the administration has only one legal authority to take action in a state, even if the law has been extended. That's because there is no such authority in the current Senate.

The new law gives the President the unilateral authority to take immediate action against foreign individuals and groups such as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria under any other name. But even without legal authority to take into account the existence of that entity, the law requires the president to take action that would result in the destruction of his or her or his property or rights.

A president can only do so if the president and the Congress are acting on his executive authority, according to federal law. But that may not apply to every person in any state or country. Trump's new proposal would be a direct example of this.

""It's a direct threat to the country's property,"" the White House press release cited. ""We're calling out the terrorist threat to our country. It's the law. It's the law.",machine
"President Trump has directed federal officials to find ways to cut funding to a string of cities controlled by Democrats, citing violence amid protests against systemic racism in policing, a move that threatens billions of dollars for many of the country?s largest urban hubs as the president makes the unrest a centerpiece of his re-election campaign.Mr. Trump laid out the directive in a memo, released Wednesday, to Russell T. Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Attorney General William P. Barr. It accuses state and local officials of abdicating their duties.?Anarchy has recently beset some of our states and cities,? Mr. Trump wrote in the memo, mentioning a few cities specifically: Portland, Ore.; Washington; Seattle; and the president?s birth city, New York. ?My administration will not allow federal tax dollars to fund cities that allow themselves to deteriorate into lawless zones.?With polls showing him trailing his Democratic rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Trump has tried to shift the public?s attention away from his administration?s failed response to the coronavirus pandemic and to what he depicts as out-of-control crime in New York and other cities. He has seized on an uptick in crime and has tried to blame it on local Democratic leaders.The president has repeatedly sought to paint cities as hellscapes that only he can save, regardless of how limited the violent outbreaks have been during broader protests against acts of brutality by police officers against Black people.The memo, which was titled ?Reviewing Funding to State and Local Government Recipients That Are Permitting Anarchy, Violence and Destruction in American Cities? and was first reported by The New York Post, ratchets up Mr. Trump?s argument. But the move is almost certain to face legal challenges, and Democrats and city officials reacted furiously. Officials in New York said they were reviewing their legal options.Bill Neidhardt, a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, said on Twitter: ?As much as Donald Trump wants New York City to drop dead, we will never let this stand. This has nothing to do with ?law and order?. This is a racist campaign stunt out of the Oval Office to attack millions of people of color.?An effort by Mr. Trump to curtail funding to so-called sanctuary cities was challenged in court, but a federal appeals court ruled this year that the administration was within its rights to withhold some funds, although three other appeals courts have ruled that the administration did not have the authority.The memo appeared to be a dagger aimed squarely at New York, where Mr. de Blasio and the state?s governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, both Democrats, have been critical of the federal response to the coronavirus. The memo went on at length about the recent rise in crime in New York City, and Mr. de Blasio?s recent agreement to cut $1 billion in funding to the New York Police Department.?To ensure that federal funds are neither unduly wasted nor spent in a manner that directly violates our government?s promise to protect life, liberty and property, it is imperative that the federal government review the use of federal funds by jurisdictions that permit anarchy, violence, and destruction in America?s cities,? the memo said.It gives Mr. Barr 14 days to identify ?anarchist jurisdictions? where officials have ?permitted violence and the destruction of property to persist and have refused to undertake reasonable measures,? although it does not specify particular cities.Mr. Vought has 30 days to direct ?heads of agencies on restricting eligibility of or otherwise disfavoring, to the maximum extent permitted by law, anarchist jurisdictions in the receipt of federal grants,? according to the memo.Among the factors that Mr. Barr is to consider in determining such jurisdictions are ?whether a jurisdiction forbids the police force from intervening to restore order amid widespread or sustained violence or destruction,? whether a jurisdiction has pulled back law enforcement after being prevented access to a certain area and ?whether a jurisdiction disempowers or defunds police departments.?The revelation that Mr. Trump was considering such a move came hours after the New York Police Department released data showing that the surge in gun violence that has rattled the city this summer and intensified the debate over policing had continued at an alarming rate in August. Shootings more than doubled last month compared with August 2019, and murders rose nearly 50 percent, the police said.The August numbers reflected a trend that many U.S. cities are contending with in a year that is already defined by a pandemic and civil unrest: a sharp rise in gun violence, murders and other crimes that has public officials grasping for explanations and scrambling to respond.Still, Democratic officials said Mr. Trump?s move was not a solution but a political ploy.Evan Hollander, a spokesman for the Democratic majority of the House Appropriations Committee, said Mr. Trump?s directive ?intrudes on Congress? power of the purse, would never stand up in court and is nothing more than a distraction from the fact that Americans are less safe under the Trump administration.?A furious Mr. Cuomo, in an evening conference call with reporters, said the president?s letter was ?another attempt to kill New York City,? where the president was long a resident and developer before officially moving to Florida last year. ?Everything that he could possibly do in his power to hurt New York City he has done,? Mr. Cuomo said, adding: ?The best thing he did for New York City was leave. Good riddance. Let him go to Florida. Be careful not to get Covid.?Mr. Cuomo also derided the president as thinking he was ?a king.??It?s cheap, it?s political, it?s gratuitous, and it?s illegal,? the governor said of the memo. Mr. Trump, he said, ?better have an army if he thinks he?s going to walk down the street in New York.?Mayor Jenny Durkan of Seattle said in an interview that the president?s call was a tactic that would further divide Americans when the country desperately needed leadership that could bring people together. She said she did not believe that the president could ?defund? cities, calling the actions unlawful.?It seems the only place where there is no respect for the rule of law is the White House,? Ms. Durkan said.Mayor Ted Wheeler of Portland tweeted that Mr. Trump ?continues to believe that disenfranchising people living in this country to advance his petty grudges is an effective political strategy.??The rest of us know it is dangerous, destructive, and divisive,? he wrote.Violent crime always increases in the summer, but the rise has been extreme this year in New York. Since May, the city has recorded 791 shootings, an increase of more than 140 compared with the same period last year. The 180 murders recorded from May to August is more than 50 percent above the same period in 2019.In August alone, there were 242 shootings in New York, compared with 91 the same month last year, and the number of murders rose to 53 from 36. As a result, the city surpassed 1,000 shootings before Labor Day, making it the worst year for gun violence since 2015, with four months left to go.Still, this year?s numbers are well below where crime peaked in the 1980s and 1990s, and the recent rise in shootings and murders follows years during which the city saw violent crime drop to levels not seen since the 1950s.The toll taken by the shootings has nonetheless been heavy. In August, the people who died from gun violence included the caretaker of a church in Brooklyn who was shot inside the church; a mother shot in the back of the head in front of a school in the Bronx; and a man struck by a stray bullet in Brooklyn while he was playing handball.Despite the surge in gun violence, police data shows that arrest numbers have declined significantly over the summer while response times to 911 calls have risen sharply.That has prompted some elected officials to call for an investigation into whether rank-and-file police officers are staging a work slowdown in response to the protests over police brutality and criminal justice reforms passed after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.Police officials have challenged that idea, asserting instead that their resources were stretched thin as they have struggled to address other demands, including policing the protests.The department?s ranks have also been thinned by the recent budget cuts cited by Mr. Trump and by a wave of retirements, leaving commanders scrambling to cover neighborhoods where violence is on the rise, officials said.Reporting was contributed by Emma G.

"Defund or dismantle the police? What it could mean? Who is the target of a potential bombing?

Ferguson police: It could be the one, just maybe the other man who has taken his own life a little longer. We do not know because there hasn't been definitive documentation on that.

How did you fall into this trap?

On a day when we were speaking, I remember sitting in the police van with a lot of people and telling them what was going on. It was just one-sided. We were just trying to keep a positive light on everybody. People were just trying to get through the day, to make a positive statement.

Were you shocked by the response?

I don't even know what that told us. The trouble is that people are just trying to hold on to their lives, to make a way for the police to take care of themselves.

Were you shocked at how many empty homes and vacant lots you had?

The best thought you could give was a one-sided picture. We don't know. It could be anybody's dream home, a funeral home, a very nice retirement home.

Is that a terrifying picture?

Yes, it seems like that's what is hiding in the shadows.

What about a police officer who shot and killed an unarmed man in Ferguson, Missouri on August 9? Did that man survive?

I'm not going to go way over this. It's enough to say that there is a reason the police in St. Louis and Ferguson don't have the means to defend us in Ferguson. I think St. Louis Police have a record of incompetence and incompetence. This is a good thing, because in a democracy everything is broken down, and journalists are supposed to take an important issue seriously and get to the bottom of it. But that isn't the case...except for the fact that Ferguson is still out there, and it is less broken than it looks.

Can you tell us what you went and did to Michael Brown?

The person who died in Ferguson lost an officer and, in the most recent case, was an officer who was targeted for assassination by a group of protesters. They are right now grieving over Michael Brown's death, but I have to say, I can't tell them that I've been doing a lot of crying, crying, hugging and wishing that they would change course and let the world know that their lives are actually over there. I don't know if it was the kind of thing that the protesters should have been doing, even if they were saving lives.

How do you feel about this?

I think that Michael Brown's death really brought a huge amount to his family's consciousness, to his community and to his supporters. It's not just about him going out and doing something like that. It's about the entire sense of goodness and support. It's really tragic that there are people in Ferguson that are supporting just cause here. These people need to understand that they're not going to just walk away saying, ""Mike, just calm down, just show up and just be a good man. I like Mike."" You can't do it by taking a hard look at them and not doing it.

The one good thing to do right now is to tell people in this community to be alive. That's not ideal. But the good is the opposite.

The best thing about going forward with this, as you know, is that as many people have been watching you do, and as many of the people have been listening to you, but as you have gotten even more attention for yourselves, is that, as an everyday person, there's this tension, does this cost them a lot of time, money and resources and they have to be prepared to go to the next day when something happens that is really upsetting. We still go to this store with this giant phone. We still go to this hospital with this old heart that goes in one of our hearts but I go back to the same hospital. It's difficult because nobody is going to be there when we get here, and nobody's willing to give up because it is difficult to move on in life at a rapid pace because nobody's willing to go to the next day. But going forward, we do see this struggle that has started but not in vain.

How do you feel about the mayor, a mayor whose police chief is now fighting back in court to protect people for his own life?

I don't know. I only know the mayor as an individual. But you can't stop being a little bit cool.

What do you think you'll do?

I think I'll make good announcements for my mayor in the next few years. But it's not to say it will be difficult. I believe I can do a lot of things, and I'm right behind the rest of the people. I want to get all my money and attention, I think I'll make good. I think that I can bring people",machine
"Defund the Police. Then Soak the Rich. The Rich was the most brutal, vicious, brutal and relentless law enforcement police department that could be.

In that time, the city of Chicago has gone from a very small city to one that is already incredibly good at cops policing ? a place that feels like the heart of Chicago. The city of Chicago went to great lengths to keep this place safe, including putting in the ""novelty"" department for a few days, including shooting a driver on the highway by a ""bad guy"" guy named ""Shooter Killer."" This is when the entire City Council voted unanimously to pass a resolution to keep cops and city employees in ""safe communities.""

In one big event at a large public meeting in Chicago last week, Mayor Rahm Emanuel and council members said that they had to use their powers of emergency response to ""make sure that police are not the same from day to day, if you call them every damn time, and when they are called to serve people, they are not calling any cops"" ? or, for that matter, call police officials across the city to put on a show of faith. The mayor has called on a very high level of police ? ""police leaders"" in Chicago ? to stand up to the federal government, and to do that by making police officers ""take care of themselves.""

The people who made those calls must be ""maintainers of our country.""

But that means letting the cops feel empowered enough to do the tough jobs they must be doing in order to help and keep the city safe. The city has an obligation to stop it now.

And it does not want the cops to be ""used."" If they are used to the police, then I am all for it.

"Charles Barkley reacts to Breonna Taylor case, dismisses 'defund the police' as 'crap'

Attorneys for the Washington state police declined to comment, including the Attorney General, state Police Patrolman Dan Randovich.

At the Detroit border, state police officials said the Trump campaign on Monday released a video showing the late ex-gay activist sitting across from a white police officer shouting at her during the violence.

Disgraced former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was arrested Saturday night on suspicion of ""participating in a hate crime.""

Trump campaign staff blamed the video, posted on social media Tuesday night, as a move ""untrue"" to police reporting that Bridgeton Jackson was acting with the plan to protect them from ""racial discrimination.""

A Maryland state police spokesman said there were no signs of violence.

""They are executing an FBI investigation that they believe is over a federal suspicion,"" he said.

Bridgeton Jackson reportedly was part of an FBI investigation into racial profiling in 2012, and it had become illegal in the state after the resignation of former state police chief and lawyer Tom McGlynn as part of a federal civil rights lawsuit.

State police reports indicated that Jackson was promoted to a special agent, meaning she could work as an escort as opposed to a flight attendant. She could also represent herself at a court appearance.

""We are trying to make sure that this investigation does not fall into any kind of Wild West,"" Randovich said. ""If people didn't do that, we are not going to be able to carry that out.""

Federal civil rights groups say the Youngstown native has struggled to get past two years of police action against her. In 2014, Jackson launched a lawsuit against the two, accusing them of racial profiling and violating her civil rights.

The ACLU said that the videos from the night of the shooting have had an impact on the investigation and has declined to comment further.

Michael Jackson says 'hateful white guys' were using racial discrimination as a tool

The historic tensions between the Donald Trump campaign and the city of Youngstown surfaced after the resignation of former state police chief Tom McGlynn, who resigned as Attorney General last year amid controversy over his ties to the Jackson campaign and other allegations of Trump's ties to the officer.

Jackson had been focused on seeking federal prosecution for his role in the 2010 ambush of two GOP troopers who were returning from a patrol stop in Old Town Michigan.

The investigation into that incident concluded in July, but prosecutors said the trooper denied any wrongdoing, claiming it was in retaliation for McGlynn's dismissal.

However, it remained unclear whether McGlynn had accepted the referral for criminal prosecution that led to him being dismissed.

McGlynn served as the state police chief from 2004 to 2007, with the hopes of becoming a public face for civil rights legislation that is critical to Trump's bid for the presidency.",machine
"Mayor Greg Fischer of Louisville, Ky., said that he would sign ?Breonna?s Law? after city council members voted unanimously on Thursday evening to ban ?no-knock? warrants, a controversial procedure that the city?s police force used during the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor in March.?I plan to sign Breonna?s Law as soon as it hits my desk,? Mr. Fischer said in a statement after the Metro Council vote. ?I suspended use of these warrants indefinitely last month, and wholeheartedly agree with Council that the risk to residents and officers with this kind of search outweigh any benefit.?In addition to barring the execution of warrants without knocking, the measure also sets new guidelines for other types of search warrants, according to a statement from the council. It requires that police officers have their body cameras on when conducting a search, and sets a minimum time period before and after the operation that the cameras must remain active.?A few weeks ago, the community began to cry out for justice and change,? said Councilwoman Barbara Saxton Smith, a primary sponsor of the ordinance, after the vote. ?You spoke, we listened, and tonight we took action.?Ms. Taylor, 26, an emergency medical technician, was killed by the police on March 13, after three officers used a no-knock warrant to enter her apartment with a battering ram, during a late-night drug investigation. The officers shot Ms. Taylor at least eight times.They have not been charged, fueling widespread protests in Louisville and in cities across the country, with many demonstrators holding up the stories of Ms. Taylor and other black people killed by officers to call for greater accountability for the police.The Louisville Police say that they fired inside Ms. Taylor?s home only after they were first fired upon by Kenneth Walker, Ms. Taylor?s boyfriend. The police said Mr. Walker wounded one of the officers, who was hit in a leg.In a 911 call just after the shooting, Mr. Walker told the dispatcher that ?somebody kicked in the door and shot my girlfriend,? according to a recording released last month.Mr. Walker was later charged with attempted murder of a police officer, though the charge was dismissed.The police also say that, despite having a no-knock warrant, they knocked several times and identified themselves as officers with a warrant before entering the apartment. The police said that the officers then ?forced entry into the exterior door and were immediately met with gunfire.? The officer who was wounded, and two others, then returned fire, the police said.The three officers involved in the case ? Jon Mattingly, Myles Cosgrove and Brett Hankison ? have been placed on administrative reassignment.Months after the shooting, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said that it had opened an investigation, and Gov. Andy Beshear said that local, state and federal prosecutors should review the police investigation that took place.On Wednesday, the Police Department released a four-page incident report of Ms. Taylor?s case but it contains minimal details, listing Ms. Taylor as a victim but saying ?none? under the section for victim injuries. The report, first published by The Louisville Courier-Journal, also has a check mark in the box designating ?no? forced entry.?This is unacceptable,? Mayor Fischer said on Twitter of the report. ?It?s issues like this that erode public confidence in @LMPD?s ability to do its job, and that?s why I?ve ordered an external top-to-bottom review of the department.?Protesters around the country have in recent weeks forced leaders to consider drastic changes to law enforcement, and called for defunding, downsizing or completely dismantling police departments.Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, has proposed a bill similar to Breonna?s Law that would outlaw the use of no-knock warrants by federal law enforcement officers.Once signed, Louisville?s new measure will require law enforcement authorities to knock on an entry door and announce themselves as having a search warrant. ?Absent exigent circumstances, wait a minimum of 15 seconds or for a reasonable amount of time for occupants to answer the door, whichever is greater, before entering the premises,? it says.Officers must have operating body cameras, activate them at least five minutes before executing the warrant, and leave them on for at least the same amount of time afterward, the measure says. All recorded data must be retained for five years, it adds.Councilwoman Jessica Green said the approval of the ban by the council was the first of many steps to reform public safety laws. ?Working with all my colleagues, this ordinance is a bipartisan effort for change,? she said in a statement.?We must not forget Breonna Taylor,? she said. ?We honor her with this new law and may this law prevent any future tragedies.?Ms. Taylor?s family members welcomed the measure. ?All she wanted to do was save lives,? her mother, Tamika Palmer, said at a news conference Thursday night. ?With this law, she?ll get to continue to do that.

"The Occupation at New York City Hall Has One Demand: Cut the NYPD Budget

One of the most expensive things the NYPD does is to cut the salaries of the officers at its most senior agency -- not to mention they only earn $16,000 a year, on top of the $9,500 that are made available for retirement. By cutting the salary of cops across the board from $16,000 to $11,000, the NYPD will save $46 billion over the next five years -- and could be able to double that over the next 20 years.

None of this means fewer cops, nor can it mean a huge tax cut for police unions. For the police union to get a tax cut the way they need it, no other proposal is necessary.

It's worth noting that this does not mean that, say, privatizing high-tech surveillance programs are an option. Recent studies from a variety of sources suggest that the police unions of the US cannot afford to reduce personnel numbers in another way.

Meanwhile, any other program such as slashing funding for the national police and failing to respond appropriately with public-private partnerships to support young people who are victims of domestic terrorism as teachers, psychologists, and public safety officials don't hold up very well with public defenders.

So far the NYPD has offered two proposals. The first was to give a $2.5 million budget to the NYPD at the state level and $3 million to the federal government, to provide private grants for each of the five agencies, to each afford the worker, one of whom could not provide enough government contracts. In this alternative way the NYPD cannot find a strong budget.

The second proposal is to give a six-figure salary cap to the the NYPD. Because of their ideology that they do not support privacy and are arrogant about their own abilities, the amount of money in the top 10 percent will be smaller than in any other middle income city. In particular, they don't like to cut the cop budget because, while it's a real bit less expensive than in cities across the country, it's not the cheapest for the NYPD.

A lot of people, for fear of less accountability from police, hate what they see as a cut in services like phone calls and the use of detention centers. But the idea behind this is not true: every citizen should be able to watch as police work. Some policemen even tell us that they watch ""areas of detention"" and still do not tell us where there is ""a private correctional facility"" located or ""where a detective works.""

This supports policing rather than criminal justice reform. It was literally only after Occupy Oakland that Al Sharpton wrote an article calling for cops to ""find a way"" to try to reform their current system and begin giving lives to everyone.

Not surprisingly, more NYPD recruits have gone on to become cops than being arrested for petty crimes. The other two proposals are to deregulate the NYPD, the Department of Education, and General Services.

By allowing these three agencies to remain closed to the public for long periods of time and under much intense scrutiny from understaffed police departments, the police union believes it can create a cultural shift where there is more empathy.

It's important to note that these three agencies are different. While ""local,"" New York City has always been a social club, but had a diverse and dedicated local leadership that grew and grew, the job market was not the result of a focus on LGBT issues or internal pressures; it was a cultural shift on our part and political experience.

That 'current, diverse, and dedicated' need is being partially overcome. It's the fight to be ""passed down as the boss of the world,"" rather than from the president and prime minister of the United States. A significant amount of these services have been eliminated from the NYPD because of these changes, and less is being spent on them. It's just more crucial that the cops decide what they need to provide on their own rather than from other departments where they are being gutted and crushed.

"In 2014, at a fundraiser for the Police Foundation, the newly elected New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, hobnobbed with the city?s elite. Among the luminaries in attendance were billionaire Wall Street investor Carl Icahn and real estate developer Bill Rudin, whose company converted St Vincent?s Hospital into a complex of luxury condominiums with units starting at the mere pittance of $16,320,623.57.As reported by the journalist Josmar Trujillo, the gala marked the first hundred days of de Blasio?s mayoralty and Bratton?s second stint as commissioner. Attendees were honored with keepsakes that included bullets and bulletproof vests courtesy of the NYPD. But the most important guests in the room, the coterie of millionaires and billionaires, were provided with the highest honor of the night: incontrovertible evidence of how private property and policing mutually constitute wealth accumulation under capitalism.To this august assemblage of the city?s most powerful residents, Bratton presented slides juxtaposing drops in crime against the accompanying rise in property values in the same neighborhoods. Mayor de Blasio, ostensibly elected as a repudiation of his predecessor?s heavy-handed policing tactics, gushed with praise: ?It?s actually incredibly inspiring to see what the work of the NYPD has achieved.? Let?s thank them for all they?ve done. I will also note, as a homeowner in Brooklyn, I was struck by the real-estate value map. There?s good news all around tonight.?The combination of rising property values and billowing police budgets have transformed the city to the detriment of many, no one more so than working-class New Yorkers of color who are squeezed by higher rents and constant police harassment. Movements to defund the police are coalescing with calls to cancel rent, as activists increasingly understand that both are essential for achieving racial and economic justice.The real estate industry?s domination of New York City since the neoliberal turn in the mid-1970s is inextricably linked to racist policing. As researchers Gin Armstrong and Derek Seidman from the Public Accountability Initiative have found, police foundations across country have partnered with corporations to supplement their budgets and purchase equipment with no public oversight ? including SWAT equipment, Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) sound equipment, drones, ballistic helmets, and a surveillance network of over 12,000 cameras, among other war weaponry.Police departments have entered into an alliance with asset manager BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and most troubling of all given its interest in facial recognition technology, Amazon. Those ties, argue Armstrong and Seidman, ?provide a key space where the relationship between the corporate elite and police forces are solidified.? BlackRock?s CEO Larry Fink cochaired the NYC Police Foundation?s annual gala from 2017 to 2019, for which in 2019 alone, he raised $5.5 million.Since Michael Bloomberg declared his intention to transform NYC into a ?luxury product? and ?to attract more very fortunate people,? because ?they are the ones that pay the bills,? the neoliberal transformation of New York City went into overdrive with more than 120 neighborhoods rezoned and rents increasing by 75 percent ? all while wages only grew 31 percent in the same period.Bloomberg did introduce ?inclusionary housing? to New York, but the word inclusionary was stretched beyond meaning. As the geographer Samuel Stein wrote in this magazine, ?most of the inclusionary housing was targeted to households making 80 percent of AMI [Area Median Income], or roughly $61,920? ? more than the city?s average income, let alone a given neighborhood?s standard. Some new apartments were built for what were termed ?middle-income households;? with rents around $3,380 a month, these were targeted at those making 175 percent of the AMI, or $135,293.Paloma Lara, an organizer at Northern Manhattan is Not for Sale/Alto Manhattan No Se Vende, got her start in tenant organizing as a sixteen-year-old through GOLES (Good Old Lower East Side) when her criminally negligent landlord tried to get her non?English speaking immigrant parents to foot the bill for a major capital improvement after the boiler exploded in the building where she and her parents lived.?People are not just being displaced from their homes by money-hungry landlords, they?re being evicted from their neighborhoods by the state,? she told Jacobin. ?In order to bring in more real estate moguls, wealth, and tax revenue, NYC has completely destroyed neighborhoods through vicious rezonings that have led to gentrification and massive displacement.? She takes particular aim at ?Mayor de Blasio?s destructive Mandatory Inclusionary Housing policy? that facilitates luxury development in exchange for an inadequate amount of ?affordable? housing.?Despite de Bill de Blasio?s talk of ?a tale of two cities? in his campaign, New York City under his mayoralty has continued to kowtow to developers? interests. As Stein argues in his book Capital City: Gentrification and the Real Estate State, both Bloomberg and de Blasio ?believed in a bigger and stronger police force, and encouraged crackdowns on homeless people and other ?quality of life? offenders. They both subscribed to the same planning paradigm, whatever the problem, the solution is luxury development.?Under Bloomberg, NYC reached the apotheosis of a long, simmering conflict between the working class and elite business interests whose main priorities were to boost property values and their own profits. In her latest book, Fear City: New York?s Fiscal Crisis and the Rise of Austerity Politics, historian Kim Phillips-Fein?s provides a comprehensive look at this struggle leading up to and during 1975 fiscal crisis.In the decades leading up to the 1970s, the working class in New York City held significant ? though by no means dominating ?power, with private and public sector unions strong enough to create a form of municipal socialism. From the 1930s to the 1960s, they pushed the city to invest in a wide range of public services, like the subway system, housing, hospitals, libraries, museums, parks, and swimming pools.Perhaps most emblematic of this era was the creation of the City University of New York, which offered high-quality education free of charge. Its flagship campus was widely known as the ?Harvard of the Proletariat? ? although like many of the era?s programs, largely excluded New Yorkers of color. The city?s social spending and union wages were also underwritten by state and federal support. From 1964?65 to 1970?71, federal grants rose from 6 to 17 percent of New York City?s municipal budget, while state grants increased from 19 to 26 percent, according to Phillips-Fein.But as deindustrialization shifted manufacturing first to the suburbs, then to southern states and finally overseas, and as the Latino and black population increased when whites fled the city, a growing racial resentment set in, which often claimed that unworthy people of color were the beneficiaries of white tax dollars.This backlash coincided with the curtailment of federal and state funding that supported an expansive social sector. Thus, the era of the Great Society came to an end ? and when Richard Nixon was elected in 1968, he did so with a mandate to end the ?era of permissiveness.? By then, elite business interests were well-positioned to claim a monopoly on the city?s future.As Phillips-Fein argues, unlike the industrialists of the postwar years who saw a clear rationale both to invest in public goods and keep rents ? and therefore wages ? low, the financial industry managers and real estate developers of the 1970s had a different set of priorities. This rising class of bankers and developers blamed high social spending and ballooning debt for causing the fiscal crisis. They wanted lower taxes for themselves and pushed for tax incentives to attract and retain businesses.If the city government was to reverse the decline in its tax base, it would have to cater more to investors and wealthy residents. Indeed, ?the major lesson that a generation of New Yorkers took from the fiscal crisis of the 1970s was that appealing to the private sector was the only way to build the city,? writes Phillips-Fein. Instead of municipal socialism, New York transitioned to a model geared toward gentrification and ?stop-and-frisk? policing.It is a strategy that has succeeded in boosting the real estate sector in the long term. Landlords and wealthy homeowners have been the major beneficiaries as property values in the city have exploded, tripling between 2000 and 2017 from $382 billion to $1.47 trillion.Local governments have an incentive to raise property values since property taxes are typically their largest source of tax revenue at about 30 percent. For NYC, it?s even higher at 44 percent.In this context, the NYPD has been rewarded for its role in raising property values for landlords and developers, with police funding increasing despite record-low crime rates. The NYPD?s budget has grown steadily since the early 1980s to $11 billion in 2020. Only the departments of education and social services receive more public money.In the wake of George Floyd?s killing, renters are pushing back and connecting the dots between insecure housing and police violence. Even before the coronavirus outbreak, hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers were teetering on the brink of eviction or sleeping on the street, while segregated in neighborhoods without support systems or living-wage jobs.According to Michael Velarde, a Chicano labor and community organizer, the crisis facing New Yorkers today ?has unfolded over generations of capital withdrawal, landlord neglect, and government abandonment that set the stage for the gentrification and displacement. When whites, capital, and the state withdrew from urban centers, they installed the police to oversee Black and Brown workers.?He explains the interplay between police violence and the concentrated need in public housing. ?The New York Police Department?sÿbudgetÿis dramatically outsized when compared to NYCHA, Velarde, toldÿThe New Republic, and ?decades of investment in the police, as well as neoliberal cuts to social spending more broadly, have resulted in overÿ$45 billion in essential repairsÿowed to NYCHA residents.??Michael Higgins, member of the Brooklyn Anti-Gentrification Network, finds that ?there is unwarranted trust in landlords who are often breaking the law and a distrust in tenants who are fighting to live in dignity by law enforcement that is becoming more clear in this moment than ever before.?No better site of struggle throws into sharper relief these contradictions than housing where the criminal neglect by landlords and city officials plays out in lurid displays of asymmetrical power. Juan Cano, a 32BJ Service Employees International Union maintenance worker in the commercial division, and his neighbors formed a tenant association at their 386 East 139 Street building in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx. In 2018, the tenant association sued their landlord due to a long history of violations, including rat infestations, water leaks, and lack of heat and hot water. Today, according to Emmanuel Pardilla, founder of the South Bronx Tenant Movement, the landlord Saul Piller continues to harass tenants, threatening to call immigration or offering buyouts of up to five thousand dollars.Piller?s father is the notorious slumlord Moshe Piller who has a history replete with abuses and neglect, including the death of two babies, one-year-old Scylee Vayoh Ambrose and two-year-old Ibanez Ambrose, at 720 Hunts Point Ave., who suffered second- and third-degree burns after a steam valve came off a radiator, filling the girls? room with scalding hot steam. After the incident, de Blasio went on WNYC?s The Brian Lehrer Show and said, ?Look, I own it.? Yet still, the Piller family continues to enjoy the benefit of city contracts through the cluster site program.Instead of enforcing housing code violations, the city government focuses on policing black bodies including in their own homes. The NYPD murders of Akai Gurley in a Brooklyn public housing stairwell and Amadou Diallo in his lobby in the Bronx are two cases in point.Renewed tenant organizing is challenging these landlord abuses, and the call to cancel rent is amplifying across the city, with powerful ramifications for the whole capitalist system. In the words of Bronx tenant organizer, Jay Espy: ?When you say cancel rent, you are really saying cancel the landlord as an entity to make them obsolete and reverse the extraction of wealth. These landlords have looted us, literally drained us. Now workers want to take back what is ours.?Socialists have long argued that police exist to protect property, and in recent decades police have focused on urban real estate. Elites understand these links well. Mayor Bloomberg, during the Occupy Wall Street protests, smugly boasted: ?I have my own army in the NYPD, which is the seventh largest army in the world.?Around that time, Emmanuel Pardilla, organizer with the South Bronx Tenant Movement, was a high school student and frequent target of stop-and-frisk. Activists like him are increasingly drawing the links between rising rents, gentrification, and policing in New York, with campaigns to defund the police merging with those to cancel rents. To build a city where we can all live with dignity requires breaking the power of the landlords and their enforcers, the police.",human
"Texas Governor Proposes Freezing Taxes in Cities That ?Defund? Police Commissioner James T. Kirk.(Photo: RICK MADRIDLEY, USA TODAY Sports) Story Highlights New York Legislature moves to ban city prostitution

Workers told a law that is exempt from freezing sex

A state Assembly panel has approved a ordinance in Baltimore that could reduce the city's prostitution license by more than half if passed by

People who are arrested for prostitution can receive waivers from the state of Maryland for their legal actions

A Baltimore city council has banned city employees, residents who are arrested if they remain in a city living room or public place who they can't go on because of a new law prohibiting the sale and trafficking of minors.

The law, which now goes into effect Oct. 10, was championed by a coalition of public interest groups and has drawn criticism from the Baltimore Sun. The bill would ban city workers from making an ""upward staggering"" amount of money doing sex with minors behind the wheel, a top-tier role for the city. The law also exempts a citywide license to sell sex to minors on city property, on or close to a specific location or on a public property.

The bill is now in the 2nd District of Maryland. Staff is still reviewing the Maryland Department of Juvenile Justice's decision to move to prohibit minors from legally owning city or high-traffic areas that a law passed by the state legislature requires city officials to review.

While some activists and attorneys who are campaigning for such a ban say city officials and police aren't ready to enforce the law, Baltimore City officials say they are worried there is still time to make sure the city does not allow the same sex-porn-fueled killings in store for all law enforcement officers.

""I think this gives Baltimore's crime-fighting community an opportunity to know that our law-and-order leadership is taking the city's problems, our crime-fighting resources stronger and is taking the resources needed to stop people from getting sex,"" Gov. Larry Hogan (D) said at a news conference Thursday. ""If we do not, this law will nullify that commitment.""

A bill originally proposed by councilman Larry Agrarian and approved by the state Senate in July could allow Baltimore to apply for waivers from the state's ban on sex-porn operations as well. Agrarian, a former police officer and civil rights lawyer, said the proposal from city hall and its supporters would be costly but be beneficial for police departments in the city's capital that rely on the city's cash-starved crime rate, which is in line with local crime rates.

""I think that any sex-based city law that comes to our council will have a ton of negative impact on public safety and not a great impact on our crime-fighting resources,"" Agrarian said.

Kirk, who chairs elected legislators in July, said his son was assaulted twice a week in the basement of the Capitol for work. Kirk's father was one day into a job interview he did not want on Capitol Hill, and he was also the only candidate on the committee. They decided to take the family out of Baltimore last year and put an enhanced statewide ban on adult street prostitution.

It stemmed from a meeting Kirk's opponent, U.S. Rep. Tony Lewis, had with the Baltimore City Council this month, which Agrarian called an opportunity for his son. Lewis said the law should be struck down as part of a larger effort to promote criminal prostitution in Baltimore.

""We have a system in place that is very cruel and has been for many, many years, that is so cruel and that is why we are in support of this ordinance,"" Kirk said.

State Sen. Ted Lieu (D-Union), who introduced the bill last fall, said he is optimistic the move will not go unnoticed, because the bill's fate could be the cause of a constitutional challenge.

""Let these people know that there is no such thing as a sex worker,"" Lieu said at a news conference Thursday. ""We are willing to work with them, but we also don't want to make it to our current position of having a problem with adult street-racing ? we've worked in Baltimore. But if this ban is not implemented, we can't support these law in Baltimore that can lead to other abuses that take place anywhere in the city.""

At the news conference, Kirk's campaign manager, Marc DeSantis, said the city's move to bar street-racing from a practice he believes was meant to harm children and the young victims of sex trafficking is unfortunate and represents unsafe business for citizens and children.

""Police are tough and they are aware of the risk of trafficking,"" DeSantis said. ""We will continue to educate our entire community on what they use as barriers to dealing with sex trafficking, and we will ensure that the crime rate of youth is not increasing even as it progresses.

"Democrats Unveil Police Reform Bill

Mr. Trump's meeting with his sons during the country's days of racial violence left no doubt in his mind how much he would help his presidency in that regard.

""I would be out there in the streets and do the Black Lives Matter thing,"" Mr. Trump said Monday afternoon in front of 12,000 people at his South Carolina golf course. ""If you look at Chicago and how far we are apart, we are very different.""

Mr. Trump Jr. said the meeting with his father featured political support from his father for a policy of law enforcement reform and supported him in making ""great"" police reform the cornerstone of his campaign.

The attorney who represented his father in the civil suit against his father said the meeting was a push to spur police reform.

""In the last week alone, I was standing in line with Mayor [Chris] Dio. Some people were pulling guns,"" said Fred R. Striner, senior counsel to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, a pro-gun group based in South Carolina.

""There was no political push from him,"" Mr. Striner said, adding that the association has heard from friends who described Mr. Trump as their support base in recent months.

The former mayor has served in the city of Miami and he has said he believes Mr. Trump's arguments are true.

In his own book, Mr. Striner is the author of:

Beyond the Confederate and Alexander Hamilton: Where we left two men dead.

Through hope and prayer and what in our hearts is inimical to each other.

Hard Times But Peaceful: A

Red Tent at Every Corner for 21 Years

Because one is Wrong and that is Law.

But then you get the idea. And the color and the conversations are often meaningless.

Please put your arms up, put your head up, God, God, let the fact that no matter what you ask somebody to say be your father's go to help you figure out what is the right thing to do. The bigger the criticism or how the praise seems on one side, the better it becomes. It has a effect on how you view your own family members and the community around you. No matter what you say and what kind of person you believe it will lead to. Or who you have friends who are who they are. You see how difficult it is. And sometimes the other guy answers. You are angry that he did this. Or frustrated with something he did not do. It happens. And sometimes those people take it personally. And sometimes they don't even care or if it is important. It doesn't matter. They want to win. They just want to sit there and do the right thing for all that they are doing.

Mr. Raskin speaks at events around the country with white nationalists in places such as Charlottesville, Virginia, where they set a torch through a statue of a Confederate general.

Chris Christie and his White House staff called on Mr. Trump on Monday, urging him to run for president with the American flag flying above his golf club.

Hate groups mounted a series of protests outside his golf club in North Charleston, S.C., last night, demanding Mr. Trump not step down from his decision to endorse the disgraced governor.

Mr. Trump still not formally announced his decision to walk away from the White House. But he has said he is not moving on his future efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.

Though Mr. Trump has offered many positions on issues related to job creation, he has instead stuck to the policy ideas of some of the most prominent Republicans on Capitol Hill.

Betsy DeVos, who was named Education Secretary last week, has led the effort to push to expand public schools to 22 states. Another agenda item on her desk is eliminating the pay gap for public school teachers.

Republicans have said any suggestion that Mr. Trump personally supports education reform could trigger a lawsuit over discriminatory teacher pay. But questions over whether he would do so on his own had big repercussions last month in Iowa where he took place.

The president-elect said during the meeting that the secretary will not take a position on his approach to education.

""Secretary DeVos needs to come to a consensus on that for her part to",machine
"MINNEAPOLIS ? Even as the Minneapolis Police Department reels in the aftermath of its officers? involvement in the killing of George Floyd, the department has been recruiting a new crop of trainees who will face the same challenge of every rookie: navigating the dramatic difference between what is preached at the academy and what is practiced on the street.In the Minneapolis Police Academy, cadets are trained to be mindful of their own biases, to treat the public with respect and to use force only when necessary. But then they enter station houses and squad cars with veteran officers who may view policing differently ? as an us-versus-them profession with a potential threat on every street corner.Since Mr. Floyd?s death, the process of turning civilians into effective officers on the Minneapolis force has taken on added urgency, and raised questions in the mind of one senior officer of how to tell who might be capable of abusive policing, such as pressing a knee into a suspect?s neck, as former Officer Derek Chauvin did on the evening of May 25 as three of his colleagues, two of them rookies, looked on.?We?re just trying to hire some more right now, and I?m just sitting there, ?How do I know which one of these guys is going to be the next Derek Chauvin??? said Cmdr. Charles Adams, a 34-year veteran who recruits officers and trains them on the necessity of community engagement. ?How do you make that determination when their record is clean as heck? We just got to weed out the ones that don?t want to buy into the program.?The death of Mr. Floyd has led to a national rethinking of police training. Some are urging significant reforms, while others complain that the current system is irredeemably broken, with a long history of policy changes that have failed to stop officers from resorting to violence too often, especially against black residents such as Mr. Floyd.His killing in police custody made clear the depth of the problem. Mr. Chauvin, who had a string of complaints against him for abusive policing, was a training officer assigned to showing new officers the basics.Those pushing for fundamental change in policing doubt whether enhanced training alone can overcome an entrenched culture of aggression that they feel is pervasive in the profession. They also question whether the basic requirements for getting a badge and a gun in the United States are sufficient.It takes more than three years to become a police officer in countries like Finland and Norway, but in some states someone can complete basic training in as little as 11 weeks. Minneapolis is on the higher end of the scale, requiring more than a year of training before swearing in a new officer.Most states require fewer minimum training hours to become licensed as a police officer than they do for barbers or cosmetologists. New York State law mandates 1,000 hours of training for massage therapists, compared with around 700 for officers. Hawaii has no minimum requirements for police officers, but manicurists must train for 300 hours.And while many police departments require additional training, 37 states permit untrained officers to work with full authority for months before attending basic training.?It?s insane that hairstylists need more training than cops in this country,? said Randy Shrewsberry, executive director of the Institute for Criminal Justice Training Reform. ?We need police officers to be educated like other professionals who are given the authority of life or death or freedom. And that takes far more than increasing training by a couple of hundred hours.?Lawmakers in Congress and state capitals have proposed measures for law enforcement training in de-escalation, use of force and dealing with mental health crises, among other situations.In Minneapolis, Mr. Chauvin was a 19-year veteran whose job included training other officers in the field. Two of the officers he had supervised were only days into the job when they responded to a 911 call accusing Mr. Floyd of using a fake $20 bill at a corner store, a relatively minor offense.As the two rookies and Mr. Chauvin held Mr. Floyd face down in the street, one of the rookies suggested turning Mr. Floyd on his side, but Mr. Chauvin, the ranking officer at the scene, declined to do so, prosecutors say.Mr. Chauvin, the two rookies and a fourth officer present were all fired and charged with crimes.?I saw murder,? Commander Adams said of the video of Mr. Floyd?s arrest, adding that it seemed to be a widespread sentiment within the department, even among officers who usually urge a wait-and-see approach when colleagues are accused of wrongdoing.One frustration, Commander Adams said, was that Mr. Chauvin?s actions erased strides he believed that the department had made to teach officers to be more accountable to communities like the predominantly black North Side.Commander Adams leads the department?s procedural justice initiatives, which include training officers on how their interactions with residents can shape public perception and affect public safety.Implicit bias training, which the department began about eight years ago, includes discussions of the aggressive policing tactics of the 1960s that damaged public trust in law enforcement and a simulated video of an officer talking disrespectfully to a black motorist only to learn later that she was the wife of a high-ranking police officer.But law enforcement officials and experts say de-escalation training is not enough.?I don?t care how many new policies and laws you pass,? said Sue Rahr, a former sheriff who is the executive director of the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission, which oversees training of all law enforcement officers in the state. ?If we don?t address the culture, that behavior is not going to change. Period. End of story.?Despite decades of community policing efforts, many of the nation?s police academies and 18,000 departments have long emphasized a warrior mentality, with officers trained for battle and equipped with the gear and weapons of modern warfare, she said.The warrior culture often begins during basic training in academies modeled on military boot camp. Police academies spend around 168 hours training recruits on firearms, self-defense and use of force, but only nine hours on conflict management and mediation, according to a Justice Department report.?If you train cops like soldiers, dress them like soldiers and equip them like soldiers, you can?t be surprised that they act like soldiers, and that?s exactly what we?ve done,? said Mr. Shrewsberry, of the Institute for Criminal Justice Training Reform. The training imbalance, he said, reinforces a ?thin blue line? police culture perpetuated in many departments by higher-ups and unions. ?There?s just this constant reiteration that cops are in constant danger,? he said.Systemic reform efforts are hindered by a lack of any centralized standards for the nation?s police departments, nearly half of which employ fewer than 10 officers, according to the Justice Department. Even though many departments provide additional training, those lessons only go so far.Washington State is widely seen as having some of the country?s highest training standards, but the police force in its largest city, Seattle, has been under federal oversight since 2012 after an investigation found that excessive force was routinely used.?Every police agency has a mission statement, but the culture is what is accepted by leadership on a day-to-day basis,? said Sean Hendrickson, an instructor at Washington State?s police academy. ?That gets backed up by other officers and is extremely deep and very difficult to change.?Becoming a police officer in Minneapolis requires first getting a peace officer license from the state, which entails as many as 1,050 hours of training. Once recruits obtain their licenses, they have to go through additional training run by the Minneapolis Police Department that includes 19 weeks in the academy. The department has said it does not employ warrior-style training, and the city banned such training outright last year, but the union has offered to pay for officers to receive it from outside vendors.After completing the academy, new officers spend five months on the streets with a field training officer, who is supposed to teach recruits how to translate what they learned in the academy to real-life situations. But that is not always the case. Current and former officers pointed to one of the first things that field training officers often say to new recruits:?Forget everything you learned in the academy.?Chief Medaria Arradondo, who has been on the Minneapolis force since 1989, said he heard it when he was coming out of the academy. That attitude is much less prevalent now, he said, but is still a concern.?We have to lay that to rest, that old culture,? he said. ?It?s about making sure that there?s ongoing training and the training in the academy just doesn?t become this subculture of a thing that you learn and you disregard.?A former Minneapolis officer, Andrew Arashiba, said in a lawsuit against the city that during his field training in 2016 and 2017, one of his training officers told him not to activate his body camera at times when it was required unless he had notified other officers first.The same training officer also once scolded him for not using force against a drunken older man they had encountered, according to the lawsuit. ?You missed a free slap,? he recalled the training officer telling him.?They have a culture and an unwritten practice of putting down anyone who opposes excessive use of force,? said Peter Nickitas, the lawyer for Mr. Arashiba.Mr. Arashiba is Japanese-American and is suing for racial and age discrimination after being terminated from the department in October 2017.The emphasis on officer safety in training can make officers feel as though they will constantly be under attack in the streets, and that can be a barrier to developing meaningful relationships with the communities they serve, said Michael Friestleben, a former Minneapolis police inspector who retired three years ago.?It was very difficult to get many of our officers to realize that the folks outside the building were not our enemies, but actually our friends,? Mr. Friestleben wrote in a blunt Facebook post last month as the streets of Minneapolis erupted in protest.When he led the Fourth Precinct, on the North Side, Mr. Friestleben said he began requiring officers to attend community events. Many complained. ?It?s not our job,? some said. ?Everybody hates us here,? others said.In 2015, when demonstrators set up an encampment outside of the Fourth Precinct station for 18 days to protest the police killing of Jamar Clark, Mr. Friestleben spent hours each day speaking with demonstrators, he said. That elicited snarls from some of his officers.?Who are you going to choose,? he recalled officers asking, ?the police or the community??The department?s inability to rid the force of that attitude has brought the city to this moment of upheaval over policing and racism, Mr. Friestleben said.?Now today we see the results of not getting to know your community,? he wrote on Facebook, ?not really serving your community, not caring about your community.?John Eligon reported from Minneapolis, and Dan Levin from New York.

"Steve Levy: Defund the police? Tried that in the '60s and '70s. Here's how it worked.

Advertisement

What he learned: The first law enforcement officers' unions started reporting on them, claiming that the officers violated the law. After the department had a ""proper investigation,"" they set up a meeting to discuss their disagreements with the officers, the Guardian reports.

What he learned: The officers wanted nothing more for their rank and file.

What they got: They were told that as part of their reform, officers could choose to serve only ""enemies of the law""?for whom an officer had the right to keep quiet.

Advertisement

What he got: The chief reported to the chief that he wanted the police to investigate the complaints of about a member who had been arrested and tortured for saying a derogatory word when speaking dirty.

What they got: They found that ""the officers' professional rules would have been relaxed by the time such allegations emerged had the subject been prosecuted within a window by a judge who would hear them.""

Advertisement

""No one from the officers involved was arrested or cited for the alleged violations of their professional standards,"" a letter from the chief stated. ""They were also dismissed because they did not meet seniority standards for the police.""

What he got: He wrote that the officers were given ""an administrative hearing"" on May 8 or the chief reportedly saw them ""a half-hour before the disciplinary hearing."" He said the officers were informed that they must appear for six consecutive days for any charges to be completed in a week. The chief's ""subsequent disciplinary hearing"" was not carried out.

Here's an archive of the letters he wrote about the police practice of treating undercover officers in a way that didn't follow law enforcement rules.

Worst of all: The officers wanted to avoid further scrutiny.

To prevent further investigations, the department wanted to avoid further scrutiny of an officer's disciplinary record. The ""controversy"" the department had ""made up is that of a lack of integrity and a lack of transparency"" in the handling of abuse reports.

Advertisement

What he got: He wrote that as a sergeant, he had just resigned from the police force after ""inaction to remove [Chief] Jeffries] from duty"" and that he saw no ""moral basis for an investigation as to the misconduct of any officer"" involved in the abuses:

I was very disappointed to find that this occurred, and that this was not done on a permanent basis, even if it is the only thing that exists. I believe the officers were fired because of the way they treated themselves: if you do it, if you don't pay the bills, that's a personal choice. They are the people who pay them and what they do.

It is no wonder his letter was sent to some of the officers, but it wasn't the only thing written during the last year to document abuses, according to Jonathan Barnett of the New York City attorney's office. In response to a complaint from a group of officers that had accused the department of hiring to investigate an officer who said he abused a minor for saying a derogatory word when speaking dirty, The New York Post reports that the officers never came back. The officers who had been removed from duty for this story were also denied any pay that they would receive.

Worst of all: He had the police report on the incident to him, the Post reports.

What he got: That part was never shown. In his memo, the department said it had not received any reports for ""dishonorable disciplinary actions,"" ""poor handling of a supervisor's personal conduct during a re-instinctive course of service"" to the officers involved.

The officers responded to a complaint by ""a senior officer of more than 100,"" according to a letter from the Department of Administrative Procedure and Enforcement Director, Joseph P. Jurgens. The letter said the officers were unable to confirm if the misconduct occurred because as part of the re-instincture or the investigation, they had ""contremained only on permanent duties"" and had not received any allegations from them. The officers ""did not receive any such reports from the supervisors for any personnel that they had in the past. They did receive reports by way of disciplinary actions against others who were in the past."" The memo added that under the policies provided to the officers themselves, a supervisor can't tell them the type of misconduct involved.

Advertisement

What they got: They set up interviews with officers but didn't interview the entire group. The officers told the supervisors they never would be informed of the findings of the investigation and so would not submit it to the disciplinary hearing, Jurgens said. The officers had no such authority.

What he got: The officers had their questions and answers to the grievances gathered in the department's civil suit alleging excessive force violations, but were never challenged. Instead, they were told that there was nothing wrong with the actions during the course of a re-instincture",machine
"New Breonna Taylor Law Will Ban No-Knock Warrants in Louisville, Ky.

First Class

After the 2014 Rams shut down the entire city and took a majority of its game in training camp, the next step for Louisville was to place one of the first pro-ready players on the court for the 2015-16 season. That meant NBA big man Michael Malone picked up on Jaylen Brown's demand that Brown return to the team and begin playing at point guard instead of starting point guard, locking up Brown. (After Brown went down with a season-ending injury, Malone had to pick up another year off of his contract, which he no longer plans to use.)

So where will the next step for Brown come from? The Lakers will finally be able to use an old contract back from last season to play point guard, while the Pelicans will try to turn back the clock to the 2014 playoffs to make a title run. That leaves the final nail in the coffin for Brown. However, based on what I've seen so far from members of the Lakers, Brown may have a different story, though.

Nick Young, the top 6-foot-9 point guard in the NBA, missed the playoffs.

Teams quickly described young Nick Young as part of their many young prospect classes with NBA star Blake Griffin and Memphis Grizzlies head coach Rick Carlisle, but of course the word ""injury"" didn't hold up there. Not only that, but Young is a member of one of the more large groups of the year. Nick Young started a dream season and ended it with his last playoff game as a starter on Nov. 22, as he helped the Lakers go to the Eastern Conference Finals.

Watch as Nick Young is a:

NFL coach Jeff Fisher brings up any star player who might be susceptible to injury, something that I think we've seen with Tayshaun Prince and Jeremy Lin as well. Nick Young is one of those players who as a kid could be on the verge of breaking out.

The Lakers built his body around Yao Ming and did an excellent job of transitioning him from raw numbers to the ""defensive bigs"" their roster now boasts. Young and Yao Ming played together for a while on the Celtics and Rockets as a place away from the NBA.

Luke Walton, another dominant player with elite stats, had a fantastic season last year, earning rave reviews from multiple sources. Among the many major moves made in the offseason, being named by ESPN as the No. 2 seed in the Southeast Louisiana Conference got a boost as he started making his NBA debut at USC. In addition to his breakneck speed, Walton averaged 10.4 assists per game over his four NBA seasons. He was the 5th best player on the team to rank No. 20 in scoring.

Walton was a very important piece in the Lakers back-to-back championship seasons from the 2014-'15 season. After playing at Maryland and Stanford, Walton averaged 6.3 points, 6.2 rebounds and 5.6 assists, no less than the fifth best player in the West for the 2014-15 season. His 16-game stretch was the longest by any player in NBA history with just seven losses. He'll be the next superstar in the league and look to finish his career with nearly 1,000 points in 14 seasons.

The piece I'm most excited about for young LeBron James (with James $2.6M buyout) are the minutes and attacking plays he's going to be able to take to the rim, and it's likely that James will hit some guys in the paint too. As I mentioned earlier, it's already too early to tell where his role will be. It's possible that he'll take a bit of a step back and focus more on developing his game, though there's much to like about James from last year in terms of being able to get up and move on from trying to contribute every day.

It'll be interesting to see what other bodies get named this offseason. I'll update this list as more info becomes available.",machine
"Over the past three years, nearly 300 public employees have filed police reports and are frequently referred to, with little detail given, about what they commit.

According to investigators this year, more than 100 people have come forward ? a record that includes many of the protesters.

The most reported cases also include several people who were involved in a rally against the police.

These include a police officer who was arrested after he allegedly punched another protester and tried to remove one of his firearms during a fight. Another group of protesters was arrested after allegedly trying to pull a car toward the crowd on a sidewalk.

Protesters claim that it is the police overstepping their constitutional rights to stop them from exercising their constitutional rights.

Demonstrators who sue police in San Diego County have filed a suit against the county after police have not seized enough metal from the protesters, said Lyle Evers, a San Diego Union-Tribune reporter who is leading the opposition to a police brutality lawsuit against police from the San Diego chapter of the National Lawyers Guild.

Both petitions are being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, which was set to represent the protestors as soon as possible, Evers said.

""The fact that we have police protection against what is going to happen to the police as soon as the protest is arrested is outrageous. It's the simple least that needs to be paid,"" Evers said.

The officers arrested are in for the taking, and have not been named as required by the city.

Policing in San Diego County

Here's an ACLU report released on April 13 about the situation in the San Diego area.

About 50 people gathered in front of City Hall in San Diego on Saturday, July 1. The protests were part of the local San Diego chapter's public meeting that drew more than 100 activists from around the country. Some were not at all angry, many were young people, people of color and people with disabilities. They were trying to find ways to end the crisis in our city.

A San Diego Police Department officer at the rally who is standing outside of City Hall said that the arrests were so severe that the crowds had been ""inflamed."" The officer cited the protests as a possible factor in that arrest.

The San Diego County Sheriff's Department has said it is not aware of a criminal case against the protesters' actions. San Diego Sheriff's spokeswoman Beth Drey said the department has received no complaints of any kind.

According to the San Diego Union County Attorney's Office, the protestors were arrested after police moved in several of the protesters. However, the city declined to discuss what that could mean.

San Diego Police Chief Ed Lee said he is not aware of any criminal case involving the protesters' actions, but said the city will be examining other possible criminal cases in accordance with the law.

""We will take appropriate actions on the part of our attorneys and will be filing reports, and we will be making appropriate policy measures on how we conduct our public protest actions,"" he said.

San Diego is one of eight cities that have recorded nearly 300 peaceful demonstrations since a May 9 police crackdown.

As many as 250 demonstrators were arrested for disorderly conduct and disorderly conduct and arrested without a permit.

The demonstrators were led by a handful of the most prominent protesters as the San Diego City Attorney's Office requested additional disciplinary action against police officers.

A group called the United States Supreme Court is seeking to overturn a unanimous decision by federal judges to ensure that the Bush administration and congressional appropriations agencies get what they want for its budget.

The lawsuit, filed Monday in Washington federal district court by President Bush, has a chance to overturn a ruling issued in September that invalidated a 2003 federal government funding bill that was due to expire at the end of that year. The government argued that the legislation could undo current funding cuts to the National Institutes of Health and other agencies, including NASA and NIH.

The government argued that the legislation would provide the federal government ""no excuse to avoid litigation through this litigation,"" when Congress created the appropriations process for fiscal year 2014 and is required to approve them. The federal funds to be used to purchase equipment for the budget would be eliminated.

In the case before the Supreme Court, the Pentagon and other agencies were seeking to have Congress take a step to pay for the Defense cuts.",machine
"In a virtual convention this week that is heavy on personality and light on policy, Democrats have presented a unified front on issues of racial justice, declaring that the status quo is not acceptable.Not far beneath the surface, however, lies broad disagreement over policing, with the reform-oriented proposals of Joseph R. Biden Jr., the party?s nominee, falling well short of the demands of progressive activists who believe that police departments need to be significantly downsized or abolished.The gap between Mr. Biden and his party?s progressive flank was evident in a line he delivered during a discussion on the Democratic National Convention?s opening night: ?Most cops are good, but the fact is, the bad ones need to be identified and prosecuted.? It struck an array of activists as discordant at a moment when the police killing of George Floyd has spurred nationwide calls for transformational change.Progressives say they see an unprecedented will and momentum to transform policing that they can?t let slip away in an election year. Having a standard-bearer who is not fully committed to the kind of fundamental change they believe is necessary could be problematic, they said.?What I?m concerned about is the continued conversation about it being a few bad apples as opposed to systemic racism in the system,? said Jamaal Bowman, the Bronx Democrat who ousted the longtime Representative Eliot Engel in a June primary. ?Part of our issue is recognizing that racism is not an individual-to-individual problem, it?s our system. It?s part of America?s DNA because we?ve never reckoned with our history of slavery.?Since Mr. Floyd?s death on Memorial Day, Mr. Biden has made eloquent calls for systemic changes to the country?s criminal justice system and proposed reforms in police tactics. But he has said he opposes cutting resources for law enforcement ? rather, he has proposed new funding for community policing, which a spokesman said would be conditioned on departments implementing reforms.As a longtime Democratic politician who has pitched himself as a champion of the working class, Mr. Biden has courted support from law enforcement unions ? groups that have resisted the sort of systemic changes and accountability for individual officers that activists and even Mr. Biden are now demanding. Mr. Biden also played an important role in passing the tough-on-crime legislation of the 1990s that many activists feel led to the abuses in the criminal justice system that fueled this summer?s protests.He has long insisted that the American law enforcement can be improved by weeding out bad personnel. He has also called for tactical reforms like banning chokeholds and ending the transferring of ?weapons of war? to police forces, and he has pledged to create a national police oversight commission within the first hundred days of his presidency.?I don?t think it?s rotten in the core,? Mr. Biden said of policing during a June interview on ?The Daily Show.? ?I don?t think all cops are bad cops.?But by cheering calls for reforms while also proposing increased funding for law enforcement and attributing problems to a few bad apples, Mr. Biden is trying to appeal to the widest possible expanse of general election voters without alienating either end of the political spectrum.?I?ve heard him speak really eloquently about systemic racism and housing,? said Vanita Gupta, who led the Justice Department?s civil rights division under former President Barack Obama. ?And he?s had a close relationship with law enforcement for many years, and I don?t think the two live as contradictory things in his mind.?In trying to have things both ways Mr. Biden risks alienating both ends of his coalition. Suburban voters ? particularly older white voters ? are less enthralled with the idea of defunding the police. And activists say a pledge to prosecute bad cops doesn?t go nearly far enough.?We have to get away from this good cop, bad cop thing,? said Cori Bush, a Missouri Democrat who went from protesting police violence in Ferguson to unseating a longtime House member this month. ?I agree with Joe Biden that something needs to change, but we have to take it much further than that. Because in the balance are dead people that look like me.?Progressive lawmakers and activists say they do not believe their differences with Mr. Biden and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, on policing will hurt him electorally. They say they can find common ground with Mr. Biden, despite their reservations about his positions, but not with President Trump, who they fear will make things only worse for Black and Hispanic people with his aggressive vision of law enforcement.?I think the vast majority of us are saying, ?I may do this with vomit in my mouth, but I?m voting for Harris and Biden because Trump has to get the hell out of office,?? said Cat Brooks, an activist based in Oakland, Calif., who has long lobbied for abolishing the police.Mr. Biden?s ?most cops are good? comment came during a conversation about racial justice he was having with prominent Democrats, including Gwen Carr, whose son, Eric Garner, was killed by the New York police in 2014. Immediately after saying ?most cops are good,? Mr. Biden turned to Ms. Carr and asked, ?How are you doing???We can?t let things settle down,? she said. ?We have to go to the politicians and we have to hold their feet to the fire. Because otherwise, the big uprising is not going to mean a lot.?Mr. Biden pumped his fist in approval.The Democratic divide over how to address policing is playing out in battles over police budgets in cities nationwide.In Minneapolis, Oakland and Seattle, city councils led by Democrats have been at odds with their Democratic mayors over how much money to cut from police coffers and invest in other services. Progressive council members have pushed for slashing the budgets in half in Seattle and Oakland. And in Minneapolis, a majority of the Council has pledged to dismantle the Police Department and create a new system of public safety.Jeremiah Ellison, a Minneapolis councilman in favor of defunding, said he had heard Democrats suggest reforms that he believed have already been tried and failed.?I think that there?s a pretty large gap,? he said of the diverging views of policing.Even seemingly small differences among Democrats can be significant, he said. He recalled a recent conversation with a former police chief in which they both agreed that public safety required more investment in things like mental health services and violence prevention. But the former chief said the police should provide those services, which Mr. Ellison opposed.?We have a fundamentally different opinion about what will work in order to competently provide those services,? he said.Part of the difficulty for Democrats to build a unified approach to policing is their diversity, Mr. Ellison said.?The Democratic Party is really several different parties,? he said. ?There are members of the Democratic Party that really have no business being in the same party together. I think maybe the thing that would tether us together is, loosely, a belief that people are more important than property and individual wealth.?While polls suggest there is broad public support for redirecting some police funding toward social services, a prospect favored even by Democratic National Committee members, there is less backing, including among Democrats, for drastically downsizing or eliminating police departments.Representative Bobby Scott of Virginia, who served as chairman of the criminal justice task force arranged by the campaigns of Mr. Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders, agreed with Mr. Biden?s sentiment.?Most cops are, in fact, good,? Mr. Scott said. ?But there are just too many that conduct themselves in such a way that violate constitutional rights and violate the law.?Like Mr. Biden, Mr. Scott opposes efforts to strip funding from law enforcement agencies. The ?Defund the Police? movement, he said, fails the test of being easily understood by a large enough segment of the electorate.?The slogan, when you immediately have to start explaining what you mean, it becomes problematic,? Mr. Scott said.But progressive lawmakers said it was important for the Democratic establishment to ensure that people who believed in drastic overhauls and even the abolishing of police departments had a seat at the table to help shape the party?s positions.?If we don?t agree to speak to each other and have the tough conversations and wrestle with the solutions together,?? said M. Lorena Gonz lez, the president of the Seattle City Council, ?then there could be the unintended consequence of people becoming disaffected with the Democratic Party, particularly young activists of color.?Democrats in Seattle have been unified around the belief that reforming the police was not enough, Ms. Gonz lez said. There is broad support for investing in things like education and health care that Democrats believe will stabilize communities and reduce crime. The tension comes in that some people also want to reduce the size of the police force, while others believe that those social investments can be made without downsizing the department, she said.Libby Schaaf, the Democratic mayor of Oakland, considers herself a progressive who believes in transformational reform in policing. But some of the city?s lawmakers and activists see Ms. Schaaf as a barrier to systemic change. She cast the deciding vote last month that prevented the Police Department?s budget from being slashed beyond the roughly $14.5 million that the City Council had cut in June.Ms. Schaaf said that while she agreed that the current system of policing did not keep everyone safe, she urged a more cautious approach to defunding because people needed someone to call when they were in crisis. But she acknowledged that Democrats who are adamant about defunding or abolishing police departments can move the needle toward necessary changes, pointing to nationwide efforts to trim police budgets that, not long ago, seemed unlikely.?There is an appetite right now for transformative change,? she said. ?And the more people get involved, the more appetite there is. People?s participation matters and has tremendous impact on policies that get put forward.?",human
"By Steve Olson, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins law firm, including in his recent book, Political Violence, in an effort to bring an end to the current civil conversation on this issue, WND has a book coming out on Monday dedicated to the life, death, and resurrection of Ronald Reagan as his new successor. In the next couple months, WND's editors will write about the most disturbing and dangerous aspects of the Bush Administration's war on drugs and the rise in drug violence.

One such and ominous aspect of the war on drugs: The rise of the war on drugs. I would like to ask WND how this has contributed to the rise of the war on drugs, but unfortunately, we remain divided. The war on drugs was the ""war on justice,"" with many politicians and lawyers openly proclaiming ""we will kill you if you don't show up and get another job."" As one former official put it, the war on drugs ""was a war on justice"" and that was the end of it for the United States, too.

I'm not suggesting that anyone was a war supporter: The war on drugs was part of the Bush administration's legal plan to use military force to kill those who supported drug efforts, and yet as another example, some states still keep track of those they kill, or the ones they kill.

The war on drugs has been a war on black people for decades, and many of those black people are in jail or prison, and some of them are just as guilty of it.

In the past few years, it has become even easier to have a free black community without the federal government's power because the law has been tightened in many states to cover all black people, including white people, people of color, people under the influence who have been charged along with them. In many ways, this has given blacks even more control of the federal government, which has been able to enforce the law, while the black community has been empowered to pursue it in a whole new way.

And as such, the drug war is the focus of WND in the United States, as the ongoing ongoing battles of drug policy across the globe are the leading cause of the death and suffering of black people. From the black community to civil rights to the law, there is no denying that this is already happening. What continues to kill black people and their children is more or less nothing, because, as a nation, blacks are just as guilty of something as can be the only ones responsible for them, including incarceration.

In spite of the increased law enforcement presence and violence around the globe, the war has also brought about new opportunities for black people to continue taking on the powerful criminal groups that created the drug trade.

It is no question that violence against black people has grown, with the police and prosecutors who have taken action have continued to take matters into their own hands, creating increased insecurity and unrest. But even if the police did have control of the population, as many have, we would still expect them to be able to defend themselves. The violence is a threat for them. That's why you should not be under the thumb of a police officer. The violence that is taking place today at the hands of police is a threat to Black Lives Matter.

The war on drugs is also an example of a government that acts and plans as an occupying power, even though it is only during times of conflict and conflict do that war occur. In his book, Killing a Black and a Black Police, a Harvard University professor explores the ramifications of police surveillance and state brutality, using the technology that they use, as an excuse to protect lawless thugs.

The war on drugs has been a great example of how the law has also become a threat to the U.S. The U.S.'s safety and security, with its lethal war on drugs, has also contributed to the rise in black crime, and even these deaths have brought about new opportunities for black people to continue taking on the powerful criminal groups that created the drug trade. But the war on drugs, according to one scholar, is part of the same ongoing pattern.

Another scholar has said that when crime is reduced to misdemeanors, as with the Black Lives Matter movement, it has a greater impact on policing. His book points that although police in other parts of the U.S. are disproportionately violent in the black community, the percentage of people sentenced to murder is in the double digits. In order to reduce crime, police are supposed to be able to conduct a more targeted investigation, but the justice system and the law are also at the mercy of the state and federal criminal justice system.

I am a professor and I understand that the vast majority of us will be arrested in a timely manner and that our right to a fair trial will extend across the country. And as long as these police officers do not put themselves in a position of justice, the government will take all the responsibility of a government that puts itself in danger.",machine
"WASHINGTON ? Republicans and Democrats in Congress have begun a new push to shut down a Pentagon program that transfers military weaponry to local law enforcement departments, as bipartisan urgency builds to address the excessive use of force and the killings of unarmed black Americans by the police.With protests turning violent across the country, lawmakers are scrutinizing the Defense Department initiative ? curtailed by former President Barack Obama but revived by President Trump ? that furnishes police departments with equipment such as bayonets and grenade launchers. The move comes after several nights when officers wearing riot gear have been documented using pepper spray and rubber bullets on protesters, bystanders and journalists, often without warning or seemingly unprovoked.The push stands in stark contrast to the reaction of Mr. Trump, who has often encouraged rough tactics by law enforcement and spent Monday complaining privately to governors that they were not handling protesters aggressively enough.?Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming presence until the violence is quelled,? Mr. Trump said in remarks from the Rose Garden on Monday evening. ?If a city or state refuses to take the actions necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them.?On Capitol Hill, however, where Republicans often take their cues from the president, most lawmakers had a different message as they focused on the immediate catalyst for the protests: George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who was killed after a police officer knelt on his neck for a prolonged period.?In no world whatsoever should arresting a man for an alleged minor infraction involve a police officer putting his knee on the man?s neck for nine minutes while he cries out ?I can?t breathe? and then goes silent,? Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said on Monday. ?Our nation cannot deafen itself to the anger, the pain and the frustration of black Americans. Our nation needs to hear this.?Top lawmakers in both parties and on both sides of the Capitol moved quickly last week to announce their intention to hold hearings on the use of excessive force by law enforcement and racial violence.Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, who has long pressed to limit the transfer of military-grade equipment to police departments, announced that he would move to include an amendment in the must-pass annual defense policy bill to shut down the program entirely.?It is clear that many police departments are being outfitted as if they are going to war, and it is not working in terms of maintaining the peace,? Mr. Schatz said in an interview. ?This is not the only thing we need to do, but as our country sees these images on television that remind us of some countries far, far away, it?s time to recalibrate this program. Just because the Department of Defense has excess weaponry doesn?t mean it will be put to good use.?Doug Stafford, Senator Rand Paul?s chief strategist, responded on Sunday night to Mr. Schatz?s idea: ?We?ve being doing this one for years. Happy to help,? he wrote on Twitter. Mr. Paul has also been a longtime proponent of the demilitarization of local police and has previously teamed with Mr. Schatz to reform the Pentagon program, known as 1033.It is unclear how much support Mr. Schatz?s measure could receive in the Republican-controlled Senate. But in the House, Representative Ruben Gallego, Democrat of Arizona and a former Marine, said on Monday that he would introduce similar legislation, opening up the possibility that the measure could find additional traction in making its way into the final defense bill.?As a combat veteran and proud Marine, very little of my equipment or training was relevant to policing Phoenix or other American communities,? Mr. Gallego said. ?Our neighborhoods aren?t war zones.?The program was created in the 1990s in an effort to offload surplus military equipment and aid police departments during the war on drugs. It expanded in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks but came under heavy scrutiny in the aftermath of a string of high-profile deaths of black men at the hands of the police, including the shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014.In response to stark images of heavily armed police confronting unarmed protesters in armored vehicles in Ferguson, Mr. Obama placed limits on that program in 2015, restricting the transfer of weapons, including battering rams and explosives, from the Pentagon to local police. The Pentagon reported in 2017 that 126 tracked armored vehicles, 138 grenade launchers and 1,623 bayonets had been returned since Mr. Obama prohibited their transfer.But Mr. Trump rescinded those restrictions in 2017, opening the flow of equipment to police departments. He argued the gear was necessary for officers to protect themselves and their communities.On his call with governors on Monday, the president appeared to applaud the National Guard?s handling of the riots in Minneapolis, pointedly remarking on their use of tear gas.?They just walked right down the street, knocking them out with tear gas, tear gas,? Mr. Trump said. ?These guys, they were running.?Secretary of Defense Mark T. Esper used military language on the same call with governors, telling them, ?we need to dominate the battle space,? and that they would have his full support.Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, on Monday laid out a framework for a series of reforms he said he hoped the Senate would take up. It included creating a national police misconduct registry, incentivizing states to adopt policies banning the use of chokeholds and reforming a legal doctrine known as qualified immunity that shields police officers from being held legally liable for damages sought by citizens whose constitutional rights were violated.?Cities are literally on fire with the pain and anguish wrought by the violence visited upon black and brown bodies,? Mr. Booker said. ?There?s no one singular policy change that will fix this issue tomorrow. We need an entire set of holistic reforms to improve police training and practices, and ensure greater accountability and transparency.?Representative Justin Amash, Independent of Michigan, said he would introduce a similar measure to strike down qualified immunity.A pattern of ?egregious police misconduct? has continued, Mr. Amash said in a letter to colleagues, ?because police are legally, politically and culturally insulated from consequences for violating the rights of the people whom they have sworn to serve. This must change so that these incidents of brutality stop happening.?",human
"Protesters set barricades and start fires in an attempt to breach the police union building; William La Jeunesse reports.Calls to defund the police have left one pragmatic Black cop in Portland with a high level of concern, according to a report in The Oregonian.?It?s really counterproductive to having well trained officers,? police Sgt. Derrick Foxworth said amid heated protests, increasing gun violence, calls for reforms and budget cuts.To train, there must be funding, he said. He noted good cops can?t come from money taken away from law enforcement.TRUMP RIPS PORTLAND RIOTERS: 'THESE ARE REALLY SICK, DISTURBED PEOPLE'He said training is always about how to get better. He said budget cuts always affect training first.In June, the City Council cut nearly $16 million from the Police Bureau budget. The cuts shuttered programs like the gun violence reduction unit, a youth services program and ended the presence of school resource officers in three school districts.In July, the city experienced a sharp rise in gun violence that has overwhelmingly hurt Black people. There were 99 shootings -- more than triple the amount from the previous July ? and the city has tallied 366 non-suicide shootings this year compared to 388 in all of 2019. Roughly two-thirds of the victims in July were Black, said Foxworth.Foxworth said July was the most violent month in the Oregon city in 30 years.?It?s frustrating ? to see the level of violence in our city in the last 60 days and it has to stop.?He said cops can?t have status quo and must always be seeking improvement, and it?s up to communities working with law enforcement.Officers and communities must have a relationship outside crisis mode to build up trust and intimacies, Foxworth explained to The Oregonian.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPBefore reform, he said there must be education.He wants the people of his city to figure out their expectations of police.There has been so much emotion but at the end of the day when we take off our badge we are part of the community and the public, Foxworth told the publication. ?We are just people at the end of the day that are really dedicated to serving our community.?",human
"To Defund the Police, We Have to Dethrone the Law Enforcement Lobby""

And you have a whole lot of other questions that have nothing whatsoever whatsoever to do with them, because they're an enemy. We'll call that ""the answer to the question of why we have to punish the police.""

And that answer is, ""You can't be doing a search investigation with no search warrants if you place out a warrant on somebody.""

Let me give you the simple one. The only way a warrant could appear to be run over indiscriminately is, I'm making you an attack on the law as well as the way police do it themselves. They don't want to see what would happen if we put out the warrants, there's a court order it's OK for us to keep our names in a separate database, they go through it again and finally after they have my name in a database, they change the information from something illegal to another database, and again they just put it in the database, then they drop it in and put it in a new database, and again they just tell us what happened.

And to put this kind of stuff in the database: The law.

[Heckening] Where's I going with this? How are they going to try to stop me? Are they going to do anything? And if anyone does it, I know.

It's also a really big problem, because it's really hard to do a search and a database search without looking. It's really difficult to do. But in a way, we're on the verge of the end of that in its most fundamental phase.

And it does happen. The FBI's case of the suspect in the case, in fact, really is a major problem.

There are three people who were involved in the case who were part of the suspecting. They're part of the suspecting of the suspect in an alleged hate crime.

Their lives have been in danger the last several weeks. As we're seen, all three were in a parking lot near a synagogue.

And they could have responded in kind of an ""internal"" way, as was the case with the Ku Klux Klan, to come out before the shooting. It's a very serious problem. What happened was, I mean, it's a major concern.

And all three were in a car that had been parked adjacent to a synagogue, and at that point, the shooter who carried out the attack was still on the ground, presumably because he had no license plates and had been out in self-defense to do whatever he could do to prevent this from happening again.

In fact, there're only three persons that knew exactly when the gunman was shot.

That's one person who was able to gather information on who he believed was behind the attacks, and another who was able to gather that information on who he thought might be responsible for the attacks, and another who didn't know what was going on.

And those were three people, I mean the FBI agent who's on everybody's front line, you have to have someone who is part of that. That's one person that's been there all along, like, for almost 20 years. I mean, we've had about seven people who knew exactly when the shooting was going to occur.

So I would say that the only reason the shooter is alive now is because of this. What happens is the bullet that takes one person to do everything and again, it does not appear in a bulletproof database, it seems to me, and then again it doesn't appear to actually be any more. So that means that it will not be a single bullet in a case, no-one will be able to have a bullet and then after that, the person still being alive will be able to help in the case. So that's why we're on the verge of a major crisis.

So the only way it could appear to be a big crisis would be by the public, but as you get older, the public is getting more political. You may not be willing to be politically engaged, but the public will be. I'd say to the first group of people who were brought up on that, you have to be sure, we are going to have to do this.

And the government seems to be on the side of the public. I mean, I know a lot of people who have no idea what's going on. They haven't spoken to me, I don't know. But I'd say that you're not going to hear things that need to be told.

I mean, I'm not sure why it needs to be told. I'll make sure that it's a crime. I think it's a crime to be responsible for it in a way?to be a person who could do that, and we're going to have to make sure that that person is not doing that, and that there is a proper accountability for that person. So we're on the side of it",machine
"WASHINGTON ? President Trump on Monday assailed a broad movement to defund police departments, invoking the kind of pro-police language that won him support with the law enforcement community in 2016 and ignoring the calls for reform that have helped shape this election.Democrats ?want to defund, and they want to abolish,? Mr. Trump told a panel at the White House composed of people who have had positive interactions with the police. The president also said that Democrats were engaging in an ?anti-cop crusade? while violent crime was rising in the cities they controlled.With Mr. Trump facing an outcry over the threats he has made to protesters calling for racial equality and police reform efforts, his remarks on Monday were part of an effort to embrace law enforcement ? and to move away from more explicitly racist language ? as polls show him lagging behind Joseph R. Biden Jr., his presumptive Democratic challenger.That has meant targeting police reform efforts supported by Democrats, such as shifting funding from police departments to social services like mental health and substance abuse counseling. Mr. Trump has called the defunding efforts a fad, but last month, he issued an executive order outlining a series of overarching principles meant to encourage ? but not mandate ? departments to alter their behavior.The president also painted a dark picture of the United States should Mr. Biden win.?The radical politicians are waging war on innocent Americans,? Mr. Trump said. ?If that?s what you want for a country, you probably have to vote for Sleepy Joe Biden because he doesn?t know what?s happening, but you are not going to have that with me.?While recent polls have shown growing support among Republicans and Democrats for instituting police reform efforts ? including banning chokeholds ? after George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis, was killed in police custody, most Americans reject the idea of defunding police departments.Mr. Trump and his campaign have tried to accuse Mr. Biden of supporting efforts to defund the police, but Mr. Biden has actually opposed them. The former vice president?s spokesman has said he supported the need for an ?urgent? overhaul after several police killings of Black men and women.The president started on his theme on Twitter on Monday by declaring that the police ?must take a stronger stand with the Radical Left politicians that are treating them so badly, and so disrespectfully.?During the White House panel, Mr. Trump blamed Democrats for upticks in crime in major cities, including New York and Chicago. Then he again targeted protesters, criticizing them for painting a Black Lives Matter sign outside Trump Tower in New York, something that made him seethe when he first saw it on television.?They ought to spend their time doing something else,? Mr. Trump said, adding, ?Last month, over 300 people were shot.?The president?s count was not accurate, but the 205 shootings in June in New York were the highest for that month since 1996, the police said. And New York surpassed 400 shootings in the first half of the year for the first time since 2016, with 528 by the end of last month.Matthew J. Hickman, a criminal justice professor at Seattle University, said that Mr. Trump and his administration were leaning into a campaign tactic of supporting police officers and calling for law and order, strategies that have been around since the Nixon era.But Mr. Hickman pointed out that the president?s efforts have been undercut by his threatening language, and that his requests for the police to toughen their responses to protesters have led to criticism from police chiefs in Chicago, Houston and elsewhere.?Any police executive with a head on their shoulders rejects this idea that they somehow need to be tougher on protesters,? Mr. Hickman said, citing as an example Art Acevedo, Houston?s police chief, who last month publicly criticized Mr. Trump?s comments. ?The ?law and order? thing is nothing new, but what is new in the Trump era is police chiefs pushing back on that.?Mr. Trump was also asked by a reporter about how he could encourage Americans to support law enforcement when his decision to commute the sentence of his longtime friend and former campaign aide Roger J. Stone Jr. appeared to undermine his own Justice Department.?Well,? Mr. Trump said, ?if you look back on it, this was an investigation that should have never taken place.?",human
"Surveillance Corporations Are More Than Happy to Ride the Wave of Police Reform

Now that the Trump administration is being prosecuted by the very same press accused of ""America First,"" the gun laws enforcement industry is being driven to suspend business as usual in all its lineups.

As the government backs off from the merciful immigration regulations Trump proposed, it is protesting publicly at the closures of major gun stores and stores on public streets, spurring whole sections of the NRA's extreme anti-Trump crusade to shut up about this latest weaponize of media. So it is a cautionary tale for reporters not to tread on the guns-free people of America's Big Bangland, because at least for the next few days, Trump's absurd farce will spread to everyone.

It's fair to say that if the Democratic Party, outside the staunchly anti-gun wing of the House, want any chance of a mainstream-government ending up in the Oval Office, it needs to stand back as necessary. They have it. There are fewer laws, more convenience, fewer arrests, and it's a minimum of concern for reporters to be so lost in the waters of greater security that they feel obligated to aggressively press stories.

"A Movement Meets a Question: Defund or Reform the Police?

Trample: A Queer Remarks In My 50's

?kiusan47.12.1996

~08/03/07

This was a long one, I've been using something like this in order to leave some aspects of the article as vague or vague as possible. This is when I notice that there was a bit of way on the surface ? page start ? and a continuation of my hazy thinking which made me wonder what I wanted to work on here.

Anyway, to summarize:

- All the police unions like with modern intelligence; they would love to have that information with them but they must have budget it already. So, I could just talk about why they even support the secret police, how an auditor could rob the police and show that the top priority should be to reform. I'll assume that as soon as I get old enough to write something now, that's all I'll ever write.

? The NYPD won't do it.

I'm glad they did!

- The PRT won't do it. It's okay. Because, of course, the cops will keep making illegal edits (you wouldn't want that at some point). And if they fail, it'd be better to ""contain"" the important information.

? The ring might love it. The way the girls think, the kids think (especially their chumles).

~03/04/07

Well, this probably went pretty well for the PRT last week because of the Moinds, and the SWT and others.

Now to clear up a few of my problems ? I'm mostly focused on their fault ? which is the disbandment of the SWT, and an ongoing policy of not holding police accountable. It has some advantages as well but it's still rather weak and anti-progressive.

For starters, there's the first really big mistake ? they're stupid enough to hold in any position the public deserves to have facts (eg. a police force that is not organized). This sets them apart. Their representatives take there job, do what they feel they should do, and then accept it and still have to cater to the needs of the general population.

This makes me upset. I actually REALLY wish they didn't go through with the decision to disband. I hope I'm wrong and get lost in this. I guess I have hope though. In a democracy and the video game world there isn't quite so much trouble with what's happening to your freedoms here. But it certainly seems they must get over themselves or find new ways to rationally display their intentions.

Another problem is that it seems to have been heavily encouraged at the time. Through email santa or a regular (obviously at least) email exchanges ? which still appears to be happening ? they've managed to use this as a way of pushing for a nationwide boycott. That's a general effect of the communist mentality that has been around for so long. And by getting involved in a boycott at all, they've gotten that message across with actual action from everyone. But they're not actually exposing us to all of this because they don't want us to (the kind of policies they're openly insisting on).

I remember when I first signed on as the SWT. (So, how did I become a member of this club?) I had a scrawny young man and his and his wife and wife's oldest daughter every Sunday for a few weeks every week to take care of the kids. And they'd come over from home and drink the rest of the alcohol and have an alcohol-free jaywalk and then leave at 4AM to go to bed early. They even sent out solicitors at the meeting that would order two pictures. It was called ""Looking For You"". No one ever sent that to them, and no one even took action on it as far as I know (except if it did ring one day, because when I went back home I had the pictures taken by another former member of this group that was sent out). Then in the spring they sent out another offer of more than 5,000 dollars for this kids.

"Minnesota activist argues 'defund the police' about 'equal treatment,' not dismantling law enforcement

During a police action on Sept. 24 in Houston, Texas, protesters helped a arrested black man to get out of the car. But as investigators prepare to break up the walk, the same man was stopped in the street and charged with resisting arrest. The Houston District Attorney's office cited Silva's arrest after five days of protests that ended with him being released on bond.

Minority activist Joseph Silva was an enraged young man, according to someone who spoke with him. Silva was taken to jail and told he couldn't have helped his cause with a walk, and told not to contact him, according to local news media.

""They're bringing you here to confront the racist and bigoted people they bring,"" Brazilian newspaper El Gao reported, citing a sheriff's deputy. ""They're making you ""disagree with you"" so that you don't get out there, and it makes you feel unsafe when they follow you. It's criminalized?""

The bizarre story echoed similar stories in other cases, including in Colorado where racist police in that state have been accused of violently stopping black men out of their homes. Those are the four federal police departments that arrest 100 people each month for disorderly conduct, traffic violations or resisting arrest. ""That number is now 90 percent,"" said the center-right news site The Post. ""That's still on top of that people we know are held to a higher standard than others are, and it's a very clear indication of police in general are under constant attack.""

Authorities in Colorado and Wisconsin see racial profiling as a way to gain ""irreconcilable"" cultural competency from African American communities.

""When you approach them with racial profiling, you take them into your own backyard with their own garbage and stashes it up in the back of your cars, they think you're holding them responsible for it,"" Scott Wilson, director of the Human Rights Project at the ACLU, told The Post.

Activists also say aggressive profiling is wrong.

""The disproportionate impact of profiling on black people, for example, in the Police Department is staggering,"" Osvaldo Diaz, president of the Black Lives Matter Resistance Network, told the Washington Post. ""There's a claim they're not understanding ? we don't understand that and we don't challenge that. No citizen should have to take that responsibility for his or her actions. It just doesn't happen.""

In 2009, after riots in the Tulsa suburb of Tulsa, Oklahoma, the Black Lives Matter Movement sprang into action. One officer was killed and 54 others were wounded during the unrest. Protesters successfully blocked construction project officials from clearing out old town sites, despite bad traffic ahead.

Video released by local news outlets at the time showed man members of the Black Lives Matter movement filming black-owned car lots as part of a strategy called Operation Rainforest. The video showed officers photographing vehicles parked in front of a lot while others made a gesture or two or ""battle"" with the tires down in their hands. The officers told the protesters that they should go, according to local news reports. The video later surfaced as footage was uploaded online.

In his interview with The Post, Habib showed images of the black offenders. ""You will see people drive up at close to 200 speed,"" he said. ""And then the trucks come into the same spot and the camera begins to clip the front of one car.""

""I don't think that's normal, I don't think that will ever happen,"" he said. ""Just look at the truck traffic. It's actually quite remarkable that so many people have stopped to get out of their cars. It's a pretty great time to be out there.""

As A. Henry Blackwell, president of the Baltimore chapter of the Black Lives Matter Action Network, told the Post, ""We don't want police departments to allow two or three incidents to all occur at the same time. There are plenty of people who choose not to make or participate in police work.""",machine
"Justice Department to Investigate Jacob Blake Shooting

Before we all get down to the flesh and put the APSIG report to vote, let's take a closer look at the shooting: The FBI may have shown up in the form of a large black D.C. area car pulled over by an undercover agent, but in reality there are many suspicious circumstances where the APSIG report may have been missing.

For instance, May 14th of the summer of 2012, 3 men drive into the parking lot of Walmart in N. H. (about 120 miles from NW Washington, where the starting time of most retail stores is 12:30am). The first man (then an undercover agent, who obtained the photograph) pulls out a gun. He pulls out a photo of a green lab, clear-yellow skin and is holding it up to the police. Later in the year, a black teenager shoots a black Walmart security guard. Those guys all appeared under surveillance. [I just want to stress this that the word security is irrelevant here. The fact that a store with two lions stands out, and is in a neighborhood with black people is something you wouldn't necessarily see.)

The police at this point call in for backup and someone directs the police car and drives away. No matter how busy the police presence was, the man will not see the three men. He describes what he saw and explains that he didn't know if they were in on it or if they were with some kind of ex-girlfriend. What the officer did not understand is that if he sees the black man running away from the shooter, the officer would not have to do anything to hold him or the shooter away. No matter what, a Black family member will find him or his family members at this point, essentially acting as a lone shooter, and as such, is ""just going to be running away."" We're talking around two people from each area of this country, all working to keep their neighborhoods and neighborhoods safe.

The shots aren't all sustained until they hit the whole store. The SUV seems to suffer from deformation, is going to be deformed when it drives itself down. Again, people were involved, but there are plenty of factors at play. There are many individuals from the night prior who are involved that day in separate incidents, but it was them being more self-righteous than many who were used to being in the middle of a fight with a cop. There were elements of going to the trunk of a sedan while the driver, armed with a weapon, was fleeing down shopping plaza in front of the store. Those same individuals fired tear gas from an unmarked Police van when they saw black shopping carts fighting.

After that point, as the car approaches the parking lot, one of the men pulls out a black Taser stun gun. At this point, the others watch with amusement, but assume their actions were justified. This morning, when I spoke with the target of the AFT news story, Brian Larow, a J and I had a lunch date with at a local pizza shop. He got out of his car, knocked out his cell phone and headed for the mall. Before he arrived at the mall, he has been tracked down in an alleyway at nearly 6:20 pm, by the police. As we went down to the elevators to the mall, it was pointed out that there were two mannequins there and a handful of others in his situation. (We have a friend who got to the mall, and we were surprised to hear he called us at the same time.) He got out of his car, stopped on the mall steps and watched for an instant. ""This's back at the airport,"" he said, mumbling that he wasn't really getting time to go home until he came back to him in two minutes. The situation was reported in the most dangerous place on the continent and he claims he was shot at a turnkey in the mall.

Then he runs back down the street and disappears into the unknown. Brian Larow, July 23, 2012 in Dulles, Virginia

At about 6:20 pm, it was reported that Michael Phelps and his girlfriend Naomi Lake were walking down the street. In a police report about the incident, the reporter reporting the story's version of events reported that they were following their mom along to save their pet.

The book is one of five of the volume, and this book is available for your reading pleasure.

In 1966, a young soldier named Edward M. Murphy was given the opportunity to find a copy of several copies of The Lord of the Rings ""on the library shelves beneath the New York City printing block in the Library of New York."" As a result, he returned to it in early 1969, reading about Peter's own son and an engrossing book about Tolkien's ""World War II"" (his sister's name was Christopher, and he's known for his passion for Tolkien's ""Oz-Y"") and to his parents, who were both also students of the school.

""We had made a brief request for a copy of the book and their father's friend William M. Murphy, editor of the New York City Weekly at the time, made it a point of meeting me for lunch. I told the guy to do whatever I'd do to get it.""

It was a brief meeting that has never been done before.

A much more personal note was written about the creation and use of numerous Tolkien volumes of ""Inverness"" that were available in some of the book stores after the sale of the original novel in 1946, published in 1967. In these journals, you can find such volumes as ""The Tale of Lorre,"" from the book's first issue in which Tolkien was quoted on page 31:

One of my dear friends, a work for me. One. In the first edition of the volume, I wrote, for instance, a little about how many times before the war was fought there, and it was not always that much in it. But this book was an attempt to explain that the war is a struggle of these times, the most difficult of the war. I was very grateful to that publisher, M. Murphy, because he was the author of the book which was being printed.

A few notes:

This volume is also available as an ""Inverness book,"" and there seem to be references to Tolkien's words, and the words ""on the library shelves beneath the New York City printing block in the Library of New York"" on the front cover. But the original description of the war's events, for the most part, is actually a very old story that goes around the war, as the author, Frank James Thinks, wrote in ""The End ... is in the Tower"" in 1964.

It may surprise some readers that I didn't read the book. Indeed, there are a number of such small parts, such as ""World War II"" with its ""A New Hope"" and ""New Hope"" but not the book that I did because it is in the book. I didn't consider myself a great reader until that book went to war. If I were to have my own book, I would say that I'd have been more shocked if I'd lived at all.

As you can see by the title, ""Gosht-Pops: The War of the World, the Greatness and Dune"" is really a poem by Tolkien himself to describe the events before the wars of the time and his vision of the world as seen in the first ""Lil' Wind"" of Tolkien. He was born into Firstborn and he attended the school for several years. He writes that he ""wand",machine

"Minneapolis City Council alarmed by surge in crime months after voting to defund the police department. (Photo By Eric Adelman of Twin Cities/Star Tribune, File)

It was, after all, a largely embarrassing scandal involving more than 150 officers.

But amid a surge in arrests a few weeks ago ? a surge that was already being acknowledged by some officials ? it was not surprising to see several figures in the national race wave on the day where the state Republican Party took up the seat as well as in Minnesota.

""There are so many people like them, I had a real hard time not seeing them as voters in Minnesota,"" said Amy Scholze, a former state Senate Democratic leader who was a speaker at the Democratic National Convention. ""We're going to need them in this state. If we don't, all of us will be voting against them.""

Some Republicans pointed to a photo of a man with an assault rifle pointing a pistol at a sitting police officer, a statement from the state Republican Party.

Though there had been a number of attacks during the Republican National Convention week but no one was charged, some were captured on video by supporters of the group. The assailant was a woman identified through the Minneapolis Star Tribune as Sally Jones.

The incident, though, appears to be a similar story, with many police and prosecutors taking particular aim at it as an indication that many Minneapolis police are not a party to the war on terror.

""Many people have a lot of bias against the police,"" said Minnesota state Sen. Debbie Stabenow, the majority leader on the committee. The incident has drawn national criticism for not giving enough support to an anti-terrorist group, and the state Republican Party has been trying to force its way in by urging a law enforcement agency to allow a public official with police training to defend herself.

Stabenow, who has served several years with the state Republican Party, said her view of the group may not be all the way in the Republican heartland, but that it represents a shift from past campaigns in the south, where Republicans had their own base and an election in mid-August that would have seen many state Republicans take up the torch as the party's candidate.

""Whether the local police force likes it or not, I think it creates a lot of new people, that have a lot of hatred for the Democratic party,"" Dubenow said.

He said that was the motive behind a few other robberies, including three men who robbed Target on June 25, the day before the party was planned.

Stabenow said she saw the photo in front of the grocery store and store where several of the men were believed to have gone to the same event. People who said they planned the robberies described themselves as law-abiding citizens rather than strangers.

""It was scary,"" she said. ""And it has become a national issue over the past year, with tension and a growing crime in our state and on our streets here in Minnesota.""

She said she was concerned about how the group was likely to spread its message and how its message of resistance could be interpreted.

Stabenow said that should have been a wake-up call.

""We're doing a fine job of just getting people to understand what the Republicans have done,"" she said. ""We're doing a good job at the same time talking about protecting people as the real enemy, the police as well as the citizens, because we know these are not Democrats, just two of the most prominent Democrats and one of the most visible Democrats.""

As for whether Republicans are ""reporters of the anti-terror vote,"" she said they should instead promote those candidates.

""The Republicans have to make a great effort to understand who they are,"" she said. ""The Democrats have to make a great effort to understand who the Republican Party is, because if they don't, then the Republican party will become the party that's going to become the party that's going to be most vulnerable to terrorist or drug traffickers.""

Jones, president of the Minneapolis Public Radio Network, said she believes the attacks show ""a certain responsibility in our society to remind the nation that we're a nation of laws passed, we have to recognize those who would be responsible for this kind of violence are not at fault.""

Stabenow did not say whether she had spoken personally with a specific suspect. However, she said that would have been the result of a meeting between the sheriff's prosecutor and the Minneapolis Police Department but that the governor had not scheduled.

A spokesman for the office of the governor suggested by email that her message to the public was ""not consistent with what we have been told by the Sheriff's Department over the past years.""

Jones said she was focused in a way she understands.

""I've lived a life that made me proud,"" she said.

She cited a photo posted of a man posing with a gun, saying that he told the group to ""do it up front",machine

""In order for a city to survive without social disruption like social unrest, crime, and gentrification, it must live with its full people, not just its citizens,"" said the council.

So, why bother?

I thought the answer.

My opponent, a person born after the 1967 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, was looking for a way to avoid a similar thing in Rio de Janeiro.

But that's what if he had come to me with a plan.

I know that he had the plan while the other person living there was already living, but I thought that because we all worked together in the meantime, I could use this plan to overcome my fear of failure.

That makes me believe one thing ?

""You know, the only way a city can survive without social disruption like Rio de Janeiro is a good, good city! Because the only other options outside the cities confines me are the city within the city walls. And that's the difference between a city that has only ever been built and a city that has never built to have that design.""

That's why I thought that his solution was so easy.

But even if it wasn't, I got another idea. It was going to be easy.

Well, this is a simple one.

The one thing I learned about life in Rio de Janeiro is that it's just beautiful.

And the only thing is the only way to live a good city is to be happy. I know you think it's nice, but make a commitment, it's not. Life is a choice you have to make.

Mah, 31-year-old resident of Westfield Street, was arrested on outstanding charges following Saturday's murder outside his apartment near the Sessorticen Grove in East York.

Mohammed Mah, 31, was found dead at the hospital after police had identified him as a suspect during an investigation.

He was taken to Westfield police station and police later arrested him on charges of murder a police officer and aggravated assault.

Mohammed was later released from jail, and detectives were told he will be freed later this year, according to the Westfield station.

Sebastian Mah is from Hertfordshire Ayrshire. He lives in Westfield and is known for wearing the same uniform as those seen earlier in the week, reports the Sessorticen Grove website. Serna said a post on Facebook last week described his death as an incident of ""incest"".

Mohammed Mah is also known for wearing a traditional black belt.

Mohammed's family and friends told News24 that his uncle had been in Syria before they were brought to the United States.

Sebastian Mah has been a resident of Westfield and maintains that police did not search away his address as the perpetrator was a ""lone enemy"" and that he did not provide any information about his life in the United States.

"In normal times, no one would feel the need to point out the total absurdity of a movement called ?Defund the Police.? The insanity of such a concept would be self-evident to anyone possessing the faculty of reason.The move to cut funding for police departments around the nation is motivated by the brutal and clearly unjustified May 25 killing of George Floyd, a black man who died when a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.Floyd was handcuffed on the ground, not resisting arrest and posing no threat to the four officers who arrested him for allegedly committing a minor crime ? passing a counterfeit $20 bill. All four officers have since fired and been charged with either second-degree murder or aiding and abetting second-degree murder. LOS ANGELES TO SLASH UP TO $150M FROM LAPD BUDGET, REINVEST INTO COMMUNITIES OF COLORFloyd?s killing ? captured on cellphone video ? has shocked millions of people around the world. As a result, we are no longer in normal times. Peaceful protests ? as well as rioting and looting ? have broken out in many American communities.Some of the groups protesting to achieve racial justice have gained frightening traction pushing the idea that slashing police budgets nationwide would help create safer communities and more peaceful interactions between blacks and whites.This is utter nonsense.We are a nation that continues to grapple with violent crime. According to the FBI, for example, an estimated 16,214 people were murderedÿin the United States in 2018. If we had fewer police on our streets that tragic figure would be higher. And you can bet that criminals would commit more robberies, assaults, rapes, burglaries and other crimes as well if there was a smaller police presence on the streets.We need police to continue to fulfill their vital function of protecting the innocent and holding lawbreakers accountable.And so, anyone who cares about America should proclaim from the rooftops that ?defunding the police? would produce terribly dangerous consequences.Police officers in the United States risk their lives to serve and protect their fellow citizens. The overwhelming majority of officers are outstanding public servants who each day perform their difficult duties for all the right reasons.This defunding makes as much sense as cutting funding for a hospital or a school where a doctor or teacher has engaged in criminal conduct against a patient or student.Certainly, there are individual cops unworthy of the badges they wear, whether due to corruption, incompetence or hot tempers that get out of control. A small number of officers hired to fight crime turn into criminals themselves, violating the rights of citizens, engaging in police brutality, and ? on rare occasions ? even killing innocent people of all races.But the solution to this problem lies in specifically identifying the officers acting improperly within police agencies ? and removing those who are incorrigible. Further, when whole departments show systematic patterns of improper behavior, wholesale leadership changes must be madeThe truth is that a small number of people in every profession engage in criminal conduct. We?ve all seen news stories about pedophile priests, doctors who rape patients, teachers who assault students, lawyers who swindle elderly clients out of their life savings, corrupt politicians who take bribes, and more. In all these professions, wrongdoers must be identified and removed from their positions ? and imprisoned if convicted of crimes.In the slow and excruciating death of George Floyd, our nation witnessed just how horrific a situation can become when bad cops walk the street. Fortunately, justice now appears to be moving swiftly in that Minneapolis case.Defunding police departments, however, would only make positive reforms all the more difficult to achieve. In a troubling move, for example, the mayor of Los Angeles has proposed cutting as much as $150 million from funding for the city?s police department.This defunding makes as much sense as cutting funding for a hospital or a school where a doctor or teacher has engaged in criminal conduct against a patient or student. In all these cases, the criminal cops, doctors and teachers would not be the ones to suffer as a result of defunding. Hospital patients, students and the general public would suffer instead.When our communities hire police officers, we ask them to risk their lives to keep our families and neighborhoods safe. According to the FBI, 89 officers were killed around the nation in the line of duty in 2019. These deaths were a tragedy that should not be ignored. The least we can do for our police officers is to ensure they have the best possible training and equipment ? and enough funding for adequate staffing.Years before he became president, Teddy Roosevelt served as New York City?s police commissioner. In his autobiography, he wrote about his longstanding commitment to adequately fund police departments. ?I have not the slightest sympathy,? he wrote, ?with any policy which tends to put the policeman at the mercy of a tough [criminal], or which deprives him of efficient weapons.?With the turmoil and strife that have wracked our nation following the killing of George Floyd, perhaps it?s understandable that many people are acting and reacting out of emotion rather than logic. But we can do better.It is shameful that a real opportunity to tackle unresolved racial discord is being hijacked by anarchists who want to destabilize our nation.Following the killing of George Floyd, we have witnessed at least a dozen additional deaths in senseless violent riots.One of these tragedies occurred with the death of David Dorn, age 77, who was killed while trying to protect a friend?s pawnshop from rampaging looters in St. Louis.Dorn, a black man, was a retired police captain. His black life mattered. The fact that he was killed by looters rather than by white police officers does not make his death any less tragic.A former colleague recalled Dorn as someone ?very dedicated to youth, especially disadvantaged youth? who ?wanted to see them succeed.? Dorn ?wanted to be a role model for those young men and women,? the former colleague said.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTERWe owe it to the memory of officers such as David Dorn ? and all honorable police officers continuing to serve their communities ? to keep supporting the work of law enforcement.And even more than that, we owe it to all our fellow citizens to pursue policies ? including adequately funding our police agencies ? that will best protect our families and neighborhoods going forward.As Americans of all races and backgrounds, let?s work together to make our police forces better.

"Top Dems punt on ?defund the police? question of social media after 'thorough and honest investigation.' (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)

On Dec. 5, 2015, MSNBC host Chris Matthews asked Trump for a call to re-open the investigation into his campaign. Trump responded with the GOP nominee's statement: ""Come on. Come on. We're going to start looking at that.""

When asked if anyone else had discussed the work involved in this, Trump denied any involvement. ""That's totally out of the scope of that meeting,"" he said.

Just a few days later, Megyn Kelly led a Democratic Senate committee attempt to create a special committee that would investigate what happened in Cleveland. Two days after the decision was announced, Megyn chose to answer the ""clear and convincing"" question of whether Trump took his word on the probe.

Trump, who created his own security firm, has been dogged by claims he improperly terminated some U.S. diplomatic ties with Russia, and charged that Moscow meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

The report in question is likely to continue in an investigative paper entitled ""Deep State: We Have a Strategic Mass Computer Lab but Were Otherwise Targeted by Russia,"" which claims U.S. intelligence agencies have now concluded that Russia was the source of an earlier attempt to harm U.S. interests in Ukraine.

Tries to identify the most relevant sources for this story, and how they was used, took an unprecedented, unprecedented turn in mid-December when you couldn't find a date with 60 minutes until the end of the report.

During the week after the report came out, Russian officials were in, late at night, trading stocks for Russia's dollar. Some Russian news outlets quickly decided to publish the report, which Russia had never before reported on.

After they published it, CNN host Chris Cuomo pushed back at Trump, who called it a ""good piece"" that ""represents the real debate going on in Washington right now.""

The report is nonetheless expected to emerge as a major ""defintion"" of Trump's political ambitions after Trump and Comey repeatedly outlined their differences, but also raised ethical questions about Trump and his ongoing investigations.

"Arkansas memorial for fallen officers defaced with 'defund the police' graffiti

The former U.S. marshal and U.S. marshal at Lake Oswego, said he had planned to turn the case against the officers to the public this week, but a judge released the rest Monday.

George J. Taylor wrote in an online news article he was involved with Brandon Brown at the time he was convicted on a slew of felony charges, including murder.

Taylor, the officer who was killed on 9th December 2011, said he was at the lake when he saw the graffiti graffiti on the ground in front of a car parking lot, and when he looked out the windows of the car door it started to glow, the report said.

""He told us the car was a big black, and then he remembered what it was,"" said Taylor.

A police officer stopped the group of policemen that night who'd spotted Brown at Lake Oswego and the downtown park for his arrest, said Taylor, who added that he didn't know if he had seen the graffiti on such a large number of occasions.

""Somebody was looking out the windows of it. Some people was looking to see the flag as I saw it, but the officer trying to identify the flag, it was just clear.""

It had to have been the police officer who hit the group and hit their man at once ? causing embarrassment to it ? said Taylor.

""He's probably the worst of the bunch in terms of injuring him and taking his head off, and a really good injury,"" Taylor said.

The officers were charged with murder after an initial conviction was obtained for Brown's murder, though the charges were later reversed in his death.

The initial charges were dropped after the judge directed the U.S. attorney to begin proceedings.

Brown's attorney says a conviction would have been required by federal sentencing guidelines, but the judge rejected that explanation.

""The trial was supposed to begin this week . . . but to be concluded early, we had to go to interview our lawyers,"" said Taylor.<|endoftext|>Frozen and the Snowpiercer, are the beloved images from Star WarsTM: The Last Jedi before the events of the original trilogy.

""To dismantle agencies filled with methodical training, operational strategies and tried and true testing ? in exchange for community-driven programs that have no experience in these areas ? is a ridiculous sentiment at best.""There is at least one precedent, though it was driven by a backlash againstÿpolice brutality.

"Tucker Carlson says calls to 'defund the police' leave him 'terrified': 'It means thugs are in charge'

Video footage shot on Wednesday shows at least two people being held against their will at Lakewood Park, north of Minneapolis.

A person is holding someone at a ""defund grand,"" said a police officer. Police said an officer who responded to the scene did not act suspiciously.



Police said several people stand next to a police dog. A man has been taken into custody.

It's unclear whether the person is being held hostage by officers.

The people shown in the footage are seen to be wearing hooded sweatshirt and are wearing dark clothing, a black t-shirt and shorts.

As it is shown is the suspect at a ""defund grand"" in this photo. Police described the scene to the Minnesota Public Broadcast Administration. (VIDEO)

The people shown in the footage were apparently not wearing hooded sweatshirts, said a police officer.

"?Police Are Not Designed to Solve the Problems People Are Facing?

My sense is that this is a tragic trend. I see it happening all the time. However, as you mentioned, I could see it happening over and over again. A great many of the people are not using Windows 7 in a productive way. They're having to deal with inconsistent defaults and huge spikes in download rates. They're probably getting better with every update. As for someone switching over to Windows 8, perhaps that has a similar effect? The security laws have been tightened. The app providers are still affected by these new protections. In fact, they are even threatening to shut down some of their services if they do not continue to pass upon their requirement to upgrade a potentially lost copy to a new version. Just last week, my old browser just ""tuned back"" so that it came back to the same sourcecode it was, while the issue took root. The logs of that system informed me that many apps went back to the same code after rebooting.

Speaking of rebooting, I had the ""Settings"" panel checked every time. I also had a standard non-installing setting changed every time you change settings, and it took a couple of minutes to update everything from new desktop to its default default settings. All I did was activate the last recommended settings for the app.

This is not a problem we're going to see again. We're not going to see a 6 year old virus reverse engineer a 7 year old, and we'll have system-level issues that require 2 years and 3 months to resolve. Of course we're going to have data leaks, and that's never going to happen.

Also, again, I have, just now recently, heard many customers come up with stories about using an antivirus on the Internet. I also've heard from some of them that if the internet doesn't stop sharing old passwords and data with multiple places on the computer, they've been turned off entirely, while you use a different key instead of your own one. The reports that have come in at random point to say that this is a problem? It is, but how will these contacts tell the stories they've given their time to tell us about this issue?

Now that's about it, that whole concept of giving patients information about healthcare care is being completely disregarded by the government and antivirus companies. It's worse than that. As someone who's gone through this kind of conversation before, I can tell you that the antivirus companies know a thing or two about keeping their advertising budgets relatively balanced. They've already started using Senser and iCloud Backup to deliver these banners and alert ads on their platforms to non-US users, which has since caused these companies to shift their usual advertising budget into the US. After all, of course, America does not actually support a third-party external storage provider, so buying bulk online programs like La Plata off of iCredit instead of data is a very risky move.

Any way you look at it, it's absolutely unbelievable that this is going on. And I'm sure other governments are, too. So I'll probably continue to give Google Inc tools to warn users and ensure they're not getting viruses on their devices. So any option that's being promoted to some companies is going to lead to thousands of far-flung and outrageous claims that they've been raided or outright charged. The bad thing about this is that the information that people have given in this way, it just cannot be true.

And I'd like to draw attention to this: I'm afraid that if you sit here and think about this for a second, one of the biggest issues is that some people who are actually concerned with security, in their terms of dealing with these kinds of issues, actually benefit from having this media flashpoint type approach. If you're going to support a major social network for free and other mainstream websites, all you have to do is add another site to the top of your feed that people are interested in that they like. People who think that getting linked to after checking Facebook on a particular site will mean more anti-virus and anti-malware websites coming to their servers every day. So this is the very real reason that any agency that uses this as an excuse to include this data in their cloud drive is set up to make malicious internet scanning as",machine
"The Police Will Do Everything They Can to Resist Accountability ? They Have to Be Defunded and Demilitarized

Shane Dlugan, 57, is a Washington-based prison free individual that spent the last four decades in the United States on parole and remains on probation. In the last two years, he's been locked up on a lawsuit against the Department of Corrections, which he blames for carrying out abuses at his house. ""No one should be put in harm's way by being incarcerated,"" he told me, recalling the beginning of his prison sentence. ""There are other prisons in the U.S. that offer better reintegration and security, but to this particular exercise in denying access, or eroding the well-being of people like me in this prison, they have to be either mass-prosecution or mass-demilitarization, even with mandatory minimum sentences and almost none of the help that has ever been provided, because the federal government basically will do whatever it can to discourage state and local jurisdictions from taking those types of actions."" The ACLU has been working with the DOJ on its own request to the Justice Department to forcibly disband the M25.

At the heart of that debate is exactly what defenders of solitary confinement and other progressive policy initiatives want to change: accountability for prison insiders. The prisoners have developed professional networks and academic contacts who have known little about community members' movement, or about the issues of color we face. They have taught people about non-violent resistance to the system. They've attended training to help deal with a high-stakes system that, many say, discourages doing anything but cooperating. They have spoken out against heavy sentencing of people who actually do do have a criminal record, such as the billionaire Carlos Slim's super-lion gang to silence women or prisoners about their conditions of incarceration. And they've successfully pushed the Justice Department to open an independent review of the state and local government who force current inmates to engage in violent private practices that end up hurting and disfiguring the rest of society, often for years, as the inmates assume they can manage whatever they want.

In the aftermath of the solitary confinement deaths, a number of studies, from 2009 and 2011, examined how the accountability policies held by state, local and federal prisons provide families with a better understanding of their kids' case studies than those of general populations. These findings offer a rare window into the opaque world of accountability regimes that function like landmines: that is, operations that have occurred in open settings are routinely halted in order to prevent bureaucratic infractions while incarceration for decades, sometimes decades, seems entirely normal and innocuous. Consider the legal difficulties for those who refuse to participate in punitive treatment when they refuse to participate in aggressive behavior without penalty. Now and again, states or local governments meet in public forums and voice concerns about prison security. And others do it the way you'd expect: issue instructions, write a letter of complaint or, if prompted by an inmate's behavior, publicly shame them in front of the media.

Still, for a justice system that serves a pre- and post-traumatic childhood and some of the biggest prison breaks of its kind in history, a lawful protest does not necessarily serve their general goal of treating criminals as equals and above all as human beings. Rather, it frequently serves as a symbolic protest. In Seattle, for example, it held a video rally against the recent mass incarceration of 600 people and decried the systemic inequality heaped on our families, poor communities, teachers, police, judges and lawyers. In the U.S., the list goes on, there's talk of injustice with taxpayer dollars; in some cities there's stand-your-ground laws that race through prison even when illegal; and most of all, there's talk of common sense, instead of a history of universal systemic injustice. But they all have moral imperative. And for most people who pursue nonviolent action, they're doing so with a deep sense of justice and compassion. So here's what we can do about it.

The public knows they're wrong and they can change them. But we need help to stop the injustice that's committed against innocent people, and not only do we need to get mental health services to help people whose incarceration is being unjustified, but we need to work to start a national conversation about how this system of incarceration operates.

"NY Times op-ed clears up 'Defund the police' confusion: 'Yes, we mean literally abolish the police'

By Steve Olson, a former deputy sheriff and deputy general

'They are not allowed to shoot, they are not allowed to carry an AK-47, a Kia 10 I, a K-9, or a Glock pistol.'

This was a comment I heard time and time again. The ""officers are for gun safety"" statement was the official version of the statement that the police received as an ""anonymous person,"" which is also the language used to describe them, apparently in response to an anonymous source telling me that the police had a request to carry a pistol to protect themselves and did not have ""clear instructions"" to do so.

The article went even further and stated that this was because the police apparently did not have ""clear instructions"" to use their weapons:

An employee at a Chicago police department who is accused of attempting to obtain a concealed carry permit issued to the Milwaukee County Police Department, was arrested Friday morning for attempted criminal possession of a carry permit under the state's concealed carry law. The attempted criminal possession of a concealed carry permit is punishable by a maximum of six months in prison, which was waived in 2013. The state's ""shall-issue concealed carry permit is intended to cover, suppress, deter, or otherwise discourage a person to carry a firearm in the right or the right way until he/she is deemed incapable of carrying it into the right way."" As a result of the unlawful possession of a concealed carry permit, a person's ability to carry a firearm and a public place have been severely restricted. This decision, which was overturned by the District Attorney Thursday, was part of a national movement whereby the federal government is required to issue a public permit because a law is interpreted to allow a person to carry a firearm in the same manner as a public space where he or she is required to be able to walk (the federal ""public place"" requirement).

The following is the full text of the ""Gun Rights Act of 1996.""

Gun Rights Act of 1996, also referred to as the ""Gun Violence Act of 1973,."" While the act prohibits most people from openly carrying weapons, it prohibits others from carrying firearms to the extent permitted by the law (while the law permits all individuals to carry weapons under their names and addresses). It also allows people who have ""reasonable self-awareness"" of their right to carry a firearm to have their weapon at all times, by simply giving them a fake gun. The act does not allow the government to arbitrarily detain the person for the purpose of exercising self-protection to any person in the county of Maryland. The act does not allow for the government to restrict firearms to those just capable of exercising their rights to obtain concealed carry permit.

Why the state wants to restrict gun ownership to criminals?with no criminal charges in some form?at all? Because I've heard people say that they are worried that someone who is going to get killed by someone being able to carry guns (which are loaded with machine guns) should be punished severely, because the government is not supposed to issue such an order. The answer is a simple question of lawlessness.

I have heard people say that they are upset that someone may be able to carry a gun at all, but then why is it that they could be caught in this way anyway? If I were an American, I'd be a little surprised that I have so little faith in the government's ability to enforce order and the law that governs firearms, just so that I could protect myself and my family against the government for being so stupid. Why am I not willing to even speak into the lives of my family, or even the risks of my life, until this is done? (I have no faith in the government.)

The reason people complain about this so much is because the government was not supposed to issue its rules upon the law to protect its citizens, which are the laws that the people actually sign in order to protect these laws. In a truly unjust world, it might be best that the government have the power to issue directions to the individuals who are trying to obtain them, though the law is not the law. People like to say that the government has a particular view that guns are OK because they are not owned by the individuals who obtained them. We are supposed to follow the law and the law should apply to all individuals, just because the law is not a specific law so everyone owns the same things. It's just a special one because the law doesn't apply to everyone.

So the reason you're complaining that the government was not supposed to issue such a command issued by the law is because the government itself was not supposed to issue command when it was, but rather that it was overreaching to take a step out of the law. The government had an obligation to issue its commands, and a person's ability to obtain firearms depends upon the individual who gained them. The law is supposed to protect the community and does not give the government access to the firearm.<|endoftext|>

"City council members pledge to completely dismantle the police department after the death of George Floyd; Matt Finn reports from Minneapolis.Minneapolis City Council President Lisa Bender dodged a question Monday morning on what people facing danger from criminals would do if her efforts to ""dismantle"" the city's police department actually succeed.Bender has been among the most vocal politicians behind the movement to dismantle the city's police force in the wake of the May 25 death of George Floydÿin the custody of the Minneapolis Police Department. Last week she said ""[w]e are goingÿto dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department and replace it with a transformative new model of public safety"" and over the weekend she joined a veto-proof majority of the council committing to ""dismantle"" the law enforcement institution.But on Monday, she struggled to answer a questionÿfrom CNN's Alisyn Camerotaÿon what would happen if a person needed help because someone had broken into their home.MINNEAPOLIS MAYOR JACOB FREY REJECTS CITY COUNCIL'S PUSH TO DEFUND POLICE, DESPITE VETO-PROOF MAJORITY""Do you understand that the word, dismantle, or police-free also makes some people nervous, for instance?"" Camerota asked. ""What if in the middle of [the] night, my home is broken into? Who do I call?""""I mean, I hear that loud and clear from a lot of my neighbors,"" Bender said.ÿ""And I know -- and myself, too, and I know that that comes from a place of privilege. Because for those of us for whom the system is working, I think we need to step back and imagine what it would feel like to already live in that reality where calling the police may mean more harm is done.""Bender detailed some of what the council's proposed reforms would mean in many cases where the police are called, but still did not answer Camerota's question directly.""We've done an analysis of all the reasons people call 911 and have looked up ways we can shift the response away from our armed police officers into a more appropriate response for mental health calls, for some domestic violence calls, for health-related issues,"" Bender said.'DEFUND THE POLICE' WRESTS SUPPORT FROM POLITICIANS FROM COAST-TO-COAST -- AND STEAMROLLS HOLDOUTSEarlier in the interview, Camerota also pushed Bender on what exactly she and her council colleagues mean when they say they want to dismantle the police department.""So what are you trying to do?"" Camerota asked. ""Are you hoping by dismantling the Minneapolis Police Department that you will be getting rid of the police department?""""I think in Minneapolis, watching George Floyd's death, and the four -- the actions of the four police officers that were involved has been a huge wake-up call for so many in Minneapolis to see what many already knew, which is that our police department is not keeping every member of our community safe,"" Bender replied.
      Lisa Bender, the president of the Minneapolis City Council, has been on the forefront of calls to dismantle that city's police department. (Minneapolis City Council)
      THESE CITIES HAVE BEGUN DEFUNDING POLICE IN THE WAKE OF GEORGE FLOYD PROTESTSCamerota further askedÿBender to confirm that she meant ""dismantle"" as something different than ""reform"" and was advocating for a ""police-free future.""""Yeah,"" Bender replied, slamming the ""militarized police force"" and saying the city should invest ""in things that we know work to keep people safe"" rather than police.Jeremiah Ellison, the son of Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and also a member of the Minneapolis City Council, was more explicit in a tweet last week.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""We are going to dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department. And when we?re done, we?re not simply gonna glue it back together,"" he said in a tweet. ""We are going to dramatically rethink how we approach public safety and emergency response. It?s really past due.""The calls to take apart the Minneapolis Police Department have been fueled by anger following Floyd's death. Police officer Derek Chauvin was seen on video usingÿhis knee to pin Floyd to the ground by his neck for nearly nine minutes, and has now been charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers who were present were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder.The incident sparked protests around the country, some of which turned into violent riots and looting. It has also sparked calls to defund the police in cities around the country, with New York and Los Angeles specifically proposing cutting huge chunks of their police budgets to redirect funds to other priorities, like social services.",human
"MINNEAPOLIS ? The burgundy Oldsmobile sped through an intersection in a tree-lined residential neighborhood on Minneapolis?s North Side, and Lisa Williams shook her head in disgust.?Look at this,? she said, surrounded by four of her young grandchildren on the short stoop of her home. ?They ride as fast as they can right down through here with no regard for the children.?It is in such moments ? when she is reminded of the many dangers in her community, from speeding cars to gunshots ? that Ms. Williams, 50, would welcome the presence of the police.But then she recalls the time several years ago when she and her husband arrived home to find several police vehicles parked on their front lawn. Officers told them to mind their own business when they asked what was going on, leading to an argument that ended with her husband getting handcuffed and taken to jail.Minneapolis?s North Side, with a majority Black population, has decidedly mixed opinions on the City Council?s effort, following the police killing of George Floyd, to significantly reduce the size and scope of Minneapolis?s police force.Residents complain of rampant police mistreatment, but also of out-of-control crime and violence. That reality has left many Black residents here unenthusiastic about what has become known as the defund movement. Adding complexity to the debate, they say that they despise the police but need someone to call when things go awry.?It does seem like a no-win situation,? Ms. Williams said.Proponents of defunding argue that having considerably fewer ? or no ? police officers could actually reduce crime because those resources could instead be invested into communities struggling with poverty.But that argument does not win over everybody.In a survey last month of likely voters in 10 battleground states, just under half of Black respondents said they would be more likely to support a candidate who made defunding the police a priority, according to the poll commissioned by Run for Something, which supports young, progressive candidates, and Collective PAC, which backs Black candidates.Reducing police department budgets drew support from 70 percent of Black Americans, according to a Gallup poll released in July. Yet only 22 percent of Black respondents supported the more drastic measure pushed by some activists of zeroing out police department budgets altogether.?What are they suggesting would be the answer if we didn?t have police?? asked Bunny Beeks, whose mother was fatally shot in North Minneapolis four years ago. ?I just don?t understand what that would look like.?The Minneapolis City Council?s proposal would not totally eliminate the Police Department. But some council members have said they would like to replace the existing department, which has been widely criticized for its aggressive attitudes toward Black residents.Most North Side residents say they hope for major reforms, including requiring officers to live in their community and better training them to interact with residents.Tiffany Roberson, whose brother, Jamar Clark, was fatally shot by the police five years ago, suggested creating a community council that could work with and oversee the police in North Minneapolis.Though skeptics say that decades of reforms have failed to create fundamental change, some residents said they had faith that Mr. Floyd?s death, and the outrage it has prompted, could make this time different.Many residents say they have confidence in Chief Medaria Arradondo, the first African-American to hold the position, saying he has shown an appetite for change that past police leaders have not. But a reform-minded chief cannot overhaul a department alone.Speaking from a North Side street corner where young men sitting on lawn chairs chat on sunny summer days, Royal Jones, 32, said he had had many brushes with law enforcement. He compared his feelings about the police to his relationship with his mother growing up. He said she might ?whoop? him for doing something wrong, and he might get mad at her for it, but at the end of the day, he still relied on her.Similarly, he said, if someone broke into his house, he would have to rely on law enforcement to handle it rather than ?go the street way,? which would just prompt more violence.?Even a person like me might need the police,? he said.Still, Mr. Jones said he believed that a better approach might be to employ community outreach workers to avert violence before it happens and interact with police officers once it occurs. Such efforts already exist, but Mr. Jones said they could be more robust.Standing nearby, his friend Kentrell Grimes, a fellow North Sider, was not necessarily buying that approach.?At the end of the day, that is still policing,? said Mr. Grimes, 25, a cook. ?This is what I?m saying, though: How can you defund the police and then bring another group to police? That?s stupid. I?m sitting here trying to wrap my brain around this.?Minneapolis proponents of defunding the police have said that these are the types of discussions that community members needed to have to decide what works best for public safety in their neighborhoods.Some may see the need for armed officers. Others may come up with a different model. Kandace Montgomery, the director of Black Visions Collective, a leading advocate of defunding in Minneapolis, acknowledged the difficulty of getting people to envision a system of public safety different from the only one they have always known.?We do have to imagine,? she said. ?I recognize that is deeply scary.?City Council members have worked closely with Black Visions Collective and other Black-led organizations in an effort to defund the Police Department. That has stirred tensions.Many North Side civic leaders and legacy organizations, like the Urban League and several Black churches, have accused elected officials of ignoring the voices of their communities as they create a path forward for policing. They point out that some of the defund movement?s leaders are based on the South Side ? where Mr. Floyd was killed by the police ? which has a much smaller Black population.?They?ve made this choice for us as Black people, when they don?t necessarily live or engage with Black people,? said Raeisha Williams, a community activist whose brother was fatally shot two years ago. ?When my house is broken into, I want to be able to call the police. When my security alarm goes off, I want to know they?re going to arrive and protect my family.?The council has proposed amending the City Charter to eliminate the Police Department as a core agency and replace it with a new public safety department. That move alone would not eliminate the police, but it would provide a blank canvas on which city leaders could create a new mechanism for public safety that could include social services and crime-prevention initiatives.The two council members representing the North Side, Phillipe Cunningham and Jeremiah Ellison, have supported the effort to change the charter and defund the police.?To say that Black North Siders have not had a voice erases the existence of two Black North Side council members,? Mr. Cunningham said.He said his constituents have told him they want to see ?transformative change in the way that the city keeps our community safe.?He acknowledged that the police could not be eliminated in one fell swoop.?We will likely need some form of law enforcement for the foreseeable future,? Mr. Cunningham said. Yet he envisioned a system in which greater investment in things like community workers, health, housing and education would stabilize the community and drive down crime.But that is difficult for many to envision right now as Minneapolis, like many other urban areas across the country, is in the midst of a spike in gun violence. The Police Department?s Fourth Precinct, which covers North Minneapolis, has seen more murders and violent crimes this year than any other precinct in the city.One of those victims of violence was Taona Mays, 24, who was sitting in the back of a friend?s sport utility vehicle on a Saturday in late July when a man walked up alongside the car and began shooting. A bullet struck her left hip, leaving her with a severe limp.?The presence of the police is definitely needed because without it, people definitely will just do anything,? said Ms. Mays, who does medical transport at a hospital.Yet she also embraces elements of what defund activists have been preaching. If there were fewer officers, she said, they would only be able to focus on major crimes rather than harassing people for petty things. She actually wants something to replace the police, she said, but she cannot think of what that would be.?It?s good to have good police,? she said. ?It?s bad to have bad police.?",human
"For president struggling on protests, ?defund the police? is a gift to his opponents. ??I do not make much sense.'

However, it appears that, after five weeks in Italy, far-right groups have actually won the parliamentary elections. Yet, a recent article in the state-run website Corriere, a popular website that had been edited between 2013 to 2014, showed more of the same. The report's author stated that, in Greece, ""a few days ago, the head of the center of the Italian political party, Letta, had defeated and then turned to the right as voters looked for a way to punish him,"" adding: ""The opposition parties have won too much support, the report noted, and this is not even surprising.""

But the latest results were a surprise to all, who had expected it to be a difficult fight. ""They must be defeated. And they have not lost hope: they are already losing.""

A senior politician from the center-right Letta, Pascali Mirandola, told the Italian daily La Stampa that, as expected, the conservative alliance should be defeated because it came closest to the first defeat. ""They are not going to face a big chance because it will be the first person losing by then.""

One of Mirandola's major reasons to keep Italy in the lead is that the national economy is still weak. ""By the end of this decade, we could see a complete rethink of our country's financial system,"" Mirandola told the paper. ""In 2008, we lost the confidence of the financial sector. Now we have to face up to the consequences.""

This means that the national debt of five of Italy's ten leading banks and 16 of the country's 14 major commercial banks is expected to increase over the balance of payments.

Some analysts view the economic results as an inevitable outcome: The state of Italian business conditions will, in the future, fall at the same way in the rest of Europe, but this will keep many of all Italians ""back up. We know it will happen.""

Meanwhile, in France, the national budget has suffered in the wake of the election of Marine Le Pen, who is far from her party's second president (and has been locked in a seven-way battle with President Fran‡ois Hollande).

A recent poll showed that the president's popularity had slipped off a cliff. At the national election, the figure had dropped to 30 percent, down three points from 44 percent on a year ago, even before the party's elections in the past.

The situation is far more complex in Italy right now than in many years past, when the National Assembly has also passed a law that will make it much more difficult for several lawmakers to introduce themselves into the state parliaments of seven other Italian state parliams.

As many as six exhibition games are set to begin tonight with 12 on the team.

""It seems like this is a difficult sport, although we have been very fortunate to have a number of teams that are absolutely committed to their teams,"" said GM Bob Hartley, who oversees the club's goal-scoring and winning teams. ""But we can't wait to see how things turn out.""

The Red Wings last played in an exhibition game against the Toronto Maple Leafs, where the Elias Pettersson and Niklas Kronwall collided and missing the game. The team is set to travel to Colorado next Monday on a game between the Blue Jackets and the Toronto Maple Leafs on Thursday at the announced 18th Street sports city.

Hartley also said the injury situation may be the most difficult between the teams -- two players have been released in the first half of the exhibition game -- but he believes the Red Wings can avoid ending their careers.

""The long season is a tough statistic,"" Hartley told The Telegraph. ""You don't really want to stop watching them play until they become injuries. Hopefully they've always been together so long and they act right even though it's a short period of time. They do things right and I hope so far it could be better, but at the same time I don't want to ever allow them to just completely disappear.""

If Hartley can go get his surgery, he's sure to fight for minutes. The Red Wings forward plans on getting well soon and said he'll definitely take part. ""I want to be ready,"" he said.

I'm not calling it ""A Brief History of America"", and it's also a compilation of short and quick facts from the past, from World Leaders in the 20th Century through to today.

By John Gurriel

More about that report I'm referring to today is here a very lengthy summary of it. Here are my personal reasons for the ""analysis"".

This presentation was a lot of fun. I got to know new people about a little bit of stuff going on here. I also got to learn more about how our country is headed after WWII. And now, I'm getting a chance to learn some of the things he said in this presentation. In the first slide you see, we're on the brink of the end of our own history. It's interesting but also an obvious one. The history of the United States in the 19th Century is very important today.

The purpose of this analysis is fairly simple. We know that the number of immigrants was much higher in the late 18th-Century than in the 1920s. However, many immigrants from the first half of the 20th Century were the result of people fleeing persecution in Nazi Germany and elsewhere. One of the things we know about this is that by the early 20th Century, the number of immigrants was in line with Adolf Hitler's efforts to use a ""rebel"" force to help the Germans conquer their enemies ? an organization that worked well with Nazi leaders, as well as with Nazi collaborators.

The ""rebel"" force, in addition to Nazis' use of a ""refugees"" force, was meant to save the people of Germany, the ""refugees"", from being crushed by Adolf Hitler. As we know from history, this was the original force that was used to help prevent Hitler's coming of surrender to the Allies. Hitler had just started a massive campaign to destroy Germany's allies, Germany and Britain, and was trying to do so by putting millions of his people in danger in Nazi-held land. Hitler has tried to use that force in Germany, but it was always going to be more or less what it was intended for. After Hitler defeated his allies, Germany was forced to invade the United States.

The United States was one of the most powerful and influential European powers for generations. One reason for the German influence is there was a huge demand by the Americans for peace. The Europeans wanted Japan put in place as a buffer zone and it worked perfectly. Japan was in some ways a big military power as well, but that was the end of Napoleon's plan for Britain to leave the European free world. The United States wanted Japan to stand alone, just as Hitler did in Britain. Hitler believed Japan might stand a little behind and he thought it was wise to let Japan's control of the Western world into British hands as an excuse why Tokyo must not be allowed to control the Western world.

One of the most notable things about the United States is that the United States is very clear in its willingness to help and its willingness to go to war with Europe. For instance, the United States wanted Japan put out at an early date to conquer Germany. Japan was the one most capable, very powerful German power in Europe at the time, to take over Hitler's home world, even if Hitler's popularity is rather small. Germany is the United States that fought in Europe until a few years ago. Even when Germany achieved an absolute victory with Germany's military intervention, Germany would have been a great power but not the United States that did not want to go to war.

To learn why Germany was the best friend of Americans after war, as well as why other European nations were more ready to go to war with America are you will need read up on the subject.

As you can see, the United States also had to have a huge foreign policy. The Germans had no idea they could do everything in order to keep Germany at bay and Germany would have made it easier for them to attack America through WWII. But they were afraid of such things as Europe and the United States. In fact, Hitler's plan of invading Germany took a long time, before World leaders began. The Germans were willing to go to",machine

"Biden says Trump seeks to 'defund the police' -- through proposed cuts to the Internal Revenue Service and a budget that excludes Planned Parenthood.

'They are pushing for tax cuts for individuals'

White House spokesman Eric Schultz said the Trump administration's budget proposal would slash a $10 billion block of funding to Planned Parenthood as well as a $8 billion ban on any state Medicaid-funded Medicaid clinics if they were approved by voters.

A Democratic member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee who is the only member of the subcommittee to reject the plan has said that he would veto it.

Democratic senators introduced a bill Tuesday that would expand taxpayer subsidies for abortions, a move that will require the U.S. Supreme Court to make a ruling in a lawsuit about Trump's plans.

In June, Sanders said the Senate proposal ""does nothing to preserve"" Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act.

Schultz said Democrats have said they are hoping to preserve these laws, a move that might require a decision by the Supreme Court.

He said that under the GOP's version, it was a budget proposal that would make up 20 percent of the budget. Sanders also said the legislation would make life more complicated than it is now as soon as possible, because the Republicans plan is ""defacing"" the American Health Care Act.

Sanders, who says the bill would repeal or replace many of Obamacare's individual market requirements -- which will likely have been killed by Trump -- called Thursday's legislation ""yet another assault on women and children.""

Democratic Sen. Ron Johnson, the only Republican senator to support the bill, said in a written statement that the bill would ""send a clear message to the president and other administration officials that if passed, this bill will have far-reaching consequences for women's health and families' economic conditions.""

""This proposed budget is the best way to fight the assault on women's health -- by repealing and replacing many of the ACA's individual market requirements,"" Sanders said.<|endoftext|>This is a feature request that was rejected by all the users of the module we know about. The following is the request that has since been answered and the fixes currently in the module.

/s/mgit/modules/mgit/modules

The following is an article in The News Page which summarizes why various new modules in that repository are being resolved as ""small changes"". This is in addition to a recent article in The News Page on the topic. It is important to understand that this change was done on a development branch of another module which is the only one that is working on. It is therefore not safe to use the Mgit Modularization (M/git) because any of the fixes we are aware of will not be available.

As a part of the Mgit M/git repo, we will implement a special feature called the ""MvM"" which allows us to use changes to a specific Maven repository on the same repo we have in the repository on which it depends. These changes are only implemented from the repository's repository branch which contains the new Maven repository that has been chosen for the project for the Maven Project for the project.

The next thing is to fix the name change rules for Maven projects. Our default Maven repository should now include the name ""Maven repository"". This is in this release version that is known to be the main repository that the project is working on. The name can be changed from Maven to Maven. These changes should be reflected later on in this release.

There are two main features which a Maven Project can use to make changes:

This requires Maven to enable changes in a specific Maven repository and also enable changes in a dependency-based (preventable) Maven repository.

The new release of the Maven M/git repository is only for Maven projects. We have been working on this release because it enables changes to the Maven repository in a way that will allow these changes to go away as much as possible.

One of our new features which we have started to develop on is the implementation of the ""Maven repository interface"". There are three main features and they are implemented in the interface. As mentioned before, we have implemented the Maven interface in our first repository:

One of our new features in the interface: https://github.com/libmogears/MavenM_migrations

The interface is very simple and can be modified easily by other repositories as we don't have any problem with it or are not too keen to implement it. The next thing is to replace the Maven M/git repo with the following:

git config = { foo: 'Maven', tag: 'Maven repository' } git config --version=0.1 commit=1.0-main.1 commit: . 0.0-1 is the new release.

It is therefore important to take note of what the library will take during the version of a project as it can be",machine
"What to Know About Calls to Defund the Police in California

According to a report by the California Bureau of Investigation, all of the calls to account for thousands of dollars in wrongful arrest and false arrests by Sheriff's Department took place in 2014, and an average of 20,000 calls were made to California State Police between January 2015 and March 2016. Sheriff's officials acknowledge that there was a technical breakdown in what some call to action means.

Questions People Involved in the Telephone Call Process: A Look at Offered Actions in The Courts

""Those who do call sheriff's (police) field offices, they are met with lots of requests for an enforcement action,"" said Deirdre Bernal, an assistant chief at the Sheriff's Office.

The calls range from murder and terrorism to serial killer, felony, arson to kidnapping. But many law enforcement officials have questions about what it is like to own and operate a police department, and who decides what they'll receive from an enforceable law.

Carl Frei, executive director of the California Law Enforcement Association, told The Local there are two very different levels of law enforcement: individual and executive. ""Officers are tasked with enforcing a system of criminal law enforcement that includes police leadership,"" Frei explained. ""They will proceed from person to person and remain in this behavior through many years, but on the other hand, in an integrated relationship, they will apply for and receive the same opportunity and that is what they're gonna do, and it's a very open relationship. That is how it's presented to them.""

The Justice Department issued an advisory last October to the California Association of Chief Law Enforcement Officers that all officers go to jail when they send an order,

""Preserve some discretion if you want to receive rights or some statutory recognition and in order to be able to enforce that the law should be interpreted to require at least'reasonable suspicion,' but that could mean some regulations.""

Not All of the Deputy Officers' Calls Are True, but They Aren't Public

Nonetheless, officials from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said that it is something of a ""terrible reminder"" that Officer Carlos Wiegler actually received over a million dollars in wrongful arrest and false arrest money from City of Santa Barbara.

Some of that money came from taxpayers. ""This is how you generate some support,"" Teresa Martinez-Griffith said.

Other departments and federal agencies are taking note of both theories. ""I think those are the tipping points and there is concern about the performance of their attorneys because there could be things there that go against those efforts,"" Hubbard told The Local. The Los Angeles Police Department has investigated multiple payments over the years, such as over $200,000 from East Los Angeles police officers.

Daniel Yuby, the spokesperson for the Southern California law enforcement law enforcement association, believes a community outcry makes it easier for public officials to enforce state law. ""It's as if the folks who are the hardest hit that want an act of public protection. ? ? That's the real opportunity that they have,"" said Yuby, noting that while it may seem obvious the San Bernardino incident occurred on purpose, it could also be a whole series of cases that law enforcement officials themselves may be involved with.

The Police Chief may not really think that this is all a coincidence, but it seems to suggest he might be. ""If the chief doesn't believe in it, then it might be that the other half (of the attack on a public space) might be inspired by him,"" Yuby said. ""You would never believe in that.""

Stephanie Davies-Quintero, the Los Angeles Police Department's communications director, was a key figure in determining where to send that money, although she said she would have received much less information as a result of the initial investigation. ""It was their understanding that it would take the threat of the police department to get back to the top,"" she said. ""And in fact they thought it was going to take some time.""

Defendants Prepare for an Acute Incident

On Jan. 21, 2015, officers working at Vista North State Station witnessed the attempt by an armed man to fire a gun at officers on various equipment, video cameras, and the entire unit. There were many reports of officers working diligently to apprehend the suspect, and officers were",machine
"MINNEAPOLIS ? Nearly two months after four of its officers were charged with killing George Floyd, the Minneapolis Police Department is reeling, with police officers leaving the job in large numbers, crime surging and politicians planning a top-to-bottom overhaul of the force.Veteran officers say that morale within the department is lower than they have ever experienced. Some officers are scaling back their policing efforts, concerned that any contentious interactions on the street could land them in trouble. And many others are calling it quits altogether.?It?s almost like a nuclear bomb hit the city, and the people who didn?t perish are standing around,? Officer Rich Walker Sr., a 16-year Minneapolis police veteran and union official, said of the mood within the department. ?I?m still surprised that we?ve got cops showing up to work, to be honest.?Many American police departments have faced challenges in retention and recruitment in recent years amid growing criticism of police abuses. But the woes in Minneapolis and elsewhere have only grown since May, when Mr. Floyd was killed after the police detained him.Nearly 200 officers have applied to leave the Minneapolis Police Department because of what they describe as post-traumatic stress, said Ronald F. Meuser Jr., a lawyer representing the officers. The prospect that a department of about 850 could lose about 20 percent of its force in the coming months has prompted major concern.Already, about 65 officers have left the department this year, surpassing the typical attrition rate of 45 a year, Chief Medaria Arradondo told the City Council during a meeting last week. Dozens of other officers have taken temporary leave since Mr. Floyd?s death, complicating the staffing picture.Minneapolis?s police force has long had a troubled relationship with the community. Excessive force complaints have become commonplace, especially by Black residents, who account for about 20 percent of the city?s population but are more likely to be pulled over, arrested and have force used against them than white residents.Cmdr. Scott Gerlicher, head of the Special Operations and Intelligence Division, wrote in an email to supervisors this month that, ?Due to significant staffing losses of late,? the department was ?looking at all options? for responding to calls, including shift, schedule and organizational changes.The email, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, also said the department would not ?be going back to business as usual.? The guiding principle going forward, Commander Gerlicher wrote, would be to ?do no harm,? and he highlighted potential reforms, including, ?Looking for reasonable and safe alternatives to police services in some areas.??Front line supervisors play the most critical role in making meaningful changes,? he wrote. ?Don?t take this lightly.?With fewer officers to patrol, some of those on the streets find themselves stretched thin and working longer hours. Complaints about the lack of support from politicians, community members and even department commanders are part of the daily conversation in precincts and squad cars.For years, police departments nationwide have faced a work force crisis, according to a report published last year by the Police Executive Research Forum. In a survey of more than 400 departments nationwide, the forum found that 63 percent of them saw a slight or significant decrease in the number of applicants over the previous five years, 41 percent had growing staff shortages and nearly half reported that officer tenures were decreasing.The current climate differs from six years ago ? when the police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., sparked national unrest ? in that the demands are not just to reform police departments, but to get rid of them, said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the forum.Many activists see an overdue reckoning for an institution that they say has long gotten away with brutalizing people of color with impunity.?Policing as an institution has largely been untouchable, despite the many, many, many failings that are cultural,? said Jeremiah Ellison, a Minneapolis City Council member who supports defunding the police. ?Here we are in a moment where people all over the country are saying, ?No, no, no, no, no, we are interested in real accountability.??Instead of embracing change, Mr. Ellison added, the police are saying, ?You?re picking on us, you don?t know how hard our job is and we?re going home.?Several officers in Minneapolis said they felt like they all were being stereotyped because of Derek Chauvin, the white former officer who knelt on Mr. Floyd?s neck for more than eight minutes before Mr. Floyd died.?If anything has the propensity to have a violent interaction, we already know we?re judged before they even hear the facts,? said Officer Walker, whose stop of a motorist 11 years ago led to a lawsuit that the city settled for $235,000 after several responding officers punched and kicked the driver in an episode captured on video.To Sasha Cotton, the director of the Office of Violence Prevention in Minneapolis, there is a cruel irony to officers saying they feel stereotyped. Her office regularly works with Black men and boys to try to keep them out of violence.?Our officers are experiencing what so often our young men and boys, who we service through the program, say they feel,? she said. ?They feel like they are being judged based on the behavior of some of their peers.?Minneapolis officers say that much of their frustration is rooted in an uncertainty over what comes next. A majority of City Council members have pledged to defund the Police Department, and they are currently in the process of trying to replace the agency with a new public safety department. Many officers say they feel like city leaders and some residents have turned their backs on them, making them less inclined to go ?above and beyond what they need to do,? said Officer Walker, the union official.?Cops have not been to the work level of before, but it?s not a slowdown,? he added. ?They?re just not being as proactive because they know they?re not supported in case something bad happens.?Officers said they were also concerned about their job security.Sgt. Anna Hedberg, a 14-year Minneapolis police veteran and board member of the Minneapolis Police Federation, the union representing officers, said a colleague recently told her he had another job opportunity. He has been on the force for six years, but it takes 10 years to be fully vested in his pension, so he was unsure whether he should leave.?I told him to leave because he?s not happy,? Sergeant Hedberg said.The tensions between the city and its Police Department come as crime is on the rise. There have been 16 homicides since June 1, more than twice as many as during the same period last year. Violent crime is up by 20 percent compared with the same stretch a year ago. Experts say there are many reasons for the spike, not just police staffing levels.Alondra Cano, a City Council member who supports defunding the police, said that any change to the department would take time and that officers would not lose their jobs overnight. It would be better for everyone ? officers included ? if they worked together toward a transition, she said.?I would prefer that people don?t resort to those extreme decisions of quitting or collecting a paycheck but not responding to calls,? she said.For one senior officer on leave because of PTSD symptoms, the problems started when he could not sleep after long nights of work during the unrest following Mr. Floyd?s death. Eventually he got headaches, he said, and lost his appetite and desire to do anything.?We were stepchildren. We were abandoned,? said the officer, who asked that his name be withheld because he was not authorized to speak to the media.He saw a therapist, who told him he should take time off. He is torn about whether he will return.?I?m coming back to chaos,? he said. ?I?m coming back to no leadership. I?m coming back to an administration that doesn?t care about the officers. I?m coming back to a City Council that doesn?t want us here. I?m coming back to a family, or a community, that doesn?t want me here. Why do I want to come back to that??Many officers are on edge in part because they believe that Chief Arradondo and other senior department leaders have not provided clear direction to the rank and file, Sergeant Hedberg said.?They?re waking up the next day: ?Is it going to be the day I get transferred? Is it the day my unit?s going to be dissolved??? she said. ?People are concerned about it.?John Elder, a spokesman for the department, said in an email: ?We have not heard those complaints; in fact I have received compliments from staff about the support from the front office.?While many officers express anxiety about the future, Officer Charles Adams III said he supported the efforts of Chief Arradondo, the first Black officer to lead the force.Although Officer Adams has felt unsupported by the community and demoralized at times ? especially after he was removed from his job as a school resource officer when the school district ended its contract with the Police Department ? he said thoughts of leaving the force never crossed his mind.?Now is not the time for us to run away,? said Officer Adams, a 19-year veteran and native of the city?s predominantly Black North Side.?I?m a Black face. I can be out there,? he added. ?I wear blue, but let?s talk: ?What do you want to see done? How can I help you?? I think it?s my opportunity to give people what they?ve been asking for.?",human
"Mike Solan, Seattle Police Officers Guild, reacts to Seattle mayor Jenny Durkan claiming Trump sending in federal agents is a 'dry run' for martial lawHundreds of Seattle residents spoke up about proposals to ?Defund the police? during a city council budget meeting on Wednesday, according to reports.The council is considering a plan that could slash the budget of the city?s police department by 50 percent ? resulting in layoffs for hundreds of officers ? all as Seattle deals with the coronavirus outbreak and frequent riots and other unrest since the May 25 death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis.While the ?Defund the police? effort was initially popular in the city, opponents of the plan have been growing more vocal, Q13 FOX of Seattle reported.SEATTLE POLICE UNION LEADER HITS BACK AFTER MAYOR CLAIMS TRUMP USING FEDS AS 'DRY RUN FOR MARTIAL LAW'?Defunding the police is a radical experiment that will hurt the vulnerable,? one member of the public, calling in to the phone-in meeting, told the council, according to Q13 FOX.?Defunding the police is a radical experiment that will hurt the vulnerable.?In addition, the Seattle Police Officers Guild, the union representing police, said it has collected more than 20,000 signatures on a ?Stop Defunding? petition, the station reported.But proponents of the ?Defund the police? plan say it would be part of an effort to repair race relations in the city following years of excessive force against minorities and other claims of mistreatment.?Nothing less than defunding will begin to heal the violence committed by police against Seattle?s Black, Brown and Indigenous communities,? said another of the estimated 300 people who signed up to address the council in a process that took about three hours, Q13 FOX reported.Seattle has been an epicenter of the rioting that has been seen in many cities across the U.S. The unrest there has included the infamous ?CHOP? (Capitol Hill Organized Protest) zone, in which protesters took over about six blocks of the city?s Capitol Hill neighborhood, looking to establish a ?police-free? area ? until the city ultimately regained control, but not before at least two fatal shootings took place.The city ? along with Portland, Ore., Chicago, and other locations ? has taken criticism from President Trump and other Republicans, who have portrayed Democratic leaders in the cities as enablers of the rioting and destruction rather than law enforcers who are dedicated to maintaining public safety.Earlier Wednesday, Seattle police union leader Michael Solan, on Fox News? ?America?s Newsroom,? lashed out against Mayor Jenny Durkan, who had claimed on CNN on Monday that President Trump was using federal agents in Seattle and other cities ?as a political tool? in what she described as a ?dry run for martial law.?Solan countered: ?Clearly what the dry runÿfor Seattle was, the [CHOP] experience where multiple people were shot and killed.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPCurrently, a veto-proof majority on the city council supports the cuts to the police department ? despite polls showing that public support is split, Q13 FOX reported.Council members have been revising the current year?s budget to account for the coronavirus outbreak.

"?Defund the police? has become a nationwide mantra, and for good reason: budget data from across the country show that spending on police has far outpaced population growth and drained resources from other public priorities.Basically, our cities have been siphoning money from stuff like education and social services and funneling the cash into ever-larger militarized security forces.Nationally, the numbers are stark: between 1977 and 2017, America?s population grew by about 50 percent, while state and local spending on police grew by a whopping 173 percent in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to data from the Urban Institute. In other words, the rate of police-spending growth was triple the rate of population growth.Chicago and New York embody the trends.The former has been losing population over the last decade. At the same time, Mayor Rahm Emanuel grew the police budget by 27 percent during his eight-year term, to the point where Chicago now spends more than 38 percent of its general fund on police. Those increases coincided with a spate of police brutality scandals, as well as budget cuts that resulted in teacher layoffs and the mass closure of Chicago public schools. And yet Chicago?s new mayor, Lori Lightfoot, has been pushing a new 7 percent increase in the police budget.In New York, it?s a similar story. Back in 2008, the city spent $4.1 billion on its police force, according to City Council documents. Twelve years later, the city is spending $6 billion on its police force. That?s a 46 percent increase during a period in which the city?s population growth was essentially flat. A new report by New York City comptroller Scott Stringer notes that in the last five years alone, spending on police rose by 22 percent, driven by a 6 percent increase in the number of officers on the force.All this happened during a period when the city experienced many years of budget cuts to social services and schools. Indeed, as Public Citizen points out, New York?s police budget is now ?more than the city spends on health, homelessness, youth development and workforce development combined.?These are hardly anomalies, as illustrated by a Center for Popular Democracy report looking at twelve major cities. That analysis concluded that ?governments have dramatically increased their spending on criminalization, policing, and mass incarceration while drastically cutting investments in basic infrastructure and slowing investment in social safety net programs? to the point where today, ?police spending vastly outpaces expenditures in vital community resources and services.?To be sure, political pundits and right-wing fearmongers will try to scandalize the ?defund the police? motto, as a way to elide and denigrate the deeper systemic criticism of the criminal justice system. Just this morning, CNN?s Chris Cillizza ? one of the most reliable purveyors of establishment conventional wisdom ? is out with a typical bullshit clickbait article headlined ?Is ?Defund the Police? a massive political mistake??Meanwhile, in typical ?well, actually? form, fossilized Democratic operatives, including an adviser to stop-and-frisk advocate Michael Bloomberg, are suddenly arguing that ?police reform? polls better than ?defunding the police.?Setting aside the grotesque spectacle of professional political mercenaries lecturing a youth-driven mass movement about proper etiquette and tone, there is the problem of so-called reforms not working. As a majority of Minneapolis City Council members declared this weekend: ?Decades of police reform efforts have proved that the Minneapolis Police Department cannot be reformed, and will never be accountable for its action.?Despite that truism, the opponents of wholesale change will inevitably continue pushing back, and they will be making two cynical bets.First and foremost, they are wagering that America is forever frozen in the Reagan-Clinton era ? the epoch in which retrograde politicians got elected berating ?superpredators,? promising ?tough on crime? measures, pledging to restore ?law and order,? and pushing to deploy ever-larger quasi-military police forces throughout our communities.They are also betting that Americans cannot process any nuance at all and that we will interpret ?defund the police? as some sort of radical idea to turn the country into a completely lawless Purge-esque hellscape.In the past, those cynical bets might have been pretty safe ? after all, for the last forty years, America has indeed remained stubbornly authoritarian, inhumane, and stupid when it comes to criminal justice policy.However, of late, there seem to be new signs that we?re getting smarter. Recent polls suggest that popular opinion is with the protesters, not the police ? and favorability ratings for police have plummeted. Additionally, the New York Times notes that ?never before in the history of modern polling has the country expressed such widespread agreement on racism?s pervasiveness in policing, and in society at large.?And because of the recent protests ? and years of prior activism and organizing ? some local politicians are starting to move forward with sweeping changes. A majority of Minneapolis City Council members announced Sunday that they are beginning ?the process of ending the Minneapolis Police Department and creating a new transformative model for cultivating safety in our city.?No rational human being thinks public officials are going to instantly disband entire police forces. Clearly, though, many rational human beings seem ready to support significant reforms of police policy. And many may similarly support a change of budget priorities.Let?s remember that only a few years ago, Donald Trump himself was submitting budgets proposing to defund the police. And now we?re seeing a similar push in some cities.Whether or not we actually follow through and make those changes will hinge on whether or not we?re willing to have an honest discussion about how these outsize spending increases on police are draining resources from everything else.",human
"The America that many speakers described on Wednesday at the Republican National Convention did not sound like a desirable place: fractious, violent, functionally lawless in some pockets.But their case that only President Trump could shield Americans from this fate was complicated by a nettlesome fact. He is in charge, at present ? at the controls of government through the purportedly real-time conditions these supporters outlined. And they would all like to keep him there.?America,? Vice President Mike Pence told a Republican convention crowd sternly from Fort McHenry in Baltimore, ?needs four more years of President Donald Trump.?The third night of the Republican convention steered into a bit of messaging jujitsu that has become a dominant theme of the week: Mr. Trump?s ability to turn back Trump-era ills that have, in this telling, been largely out of his hands to date.And so the president, the argument has gone, can be relied upon now to safeguard Americans against the threats they see all around them, in the nation he leads.?People that can afford to flee have fled,? Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota said of cities like Portland, Ore., and New York. ?But the people that can?t ? good, hard-working Americans ? are left to fend for themselves.?transcript[music] [applause] Crowd: ?Four more years! Four more years!? ?Joe Biden said that we were living through a ?season of darkness.? But as President Trump said, where Joe Biden sees American darkness, we see American greatness. Four years ago, I answered the call to join this ticket, because I knew that Donald Trump had the leadership and the vision to make America great again. And for the last four years, I?ve watched this president endure unrelenting attacks but get up every day and fight to keep the promises that he made to the American people. My fellow Americans, we?re passing through a time of testing, when in the midst of this global pandemic, just as our nation had begun to recover, we?ve seen violence and chaos in the streets of our major cities. President Trump and I will always support the right of Americans to peaceful protest, but rioting and looting is not peaceful protest, tearing down statues is not free speech, and those who do so will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. [applause] So let me be clear: The violence must stop ? whether in Minneapolis, Portland or Kenosha. Too many heroes have died defending our freedom to see Americans strike each other down. We will have law and order on the streets of this country for every American of every race and creed and color.? [cheering] ?President Trump has stood up for our heroes every day. He stood by our law enforcement, our military and the freedoms we hold dear. He?s made good on his promise to put America first. And I hope you will stand with me as we send him back for four more years, with a clear message to the Democrats: You will never cancel our heroes.? ?You may know me as a supporter of President Trump. But tonight I?m here to share with you how he supported me ? both as a new mom and as an American with a pre-existing condition. When I was 21 years old, I got a call that changed my life. It was my doctor, informing me that I had tested positive for the BRCA2 genetic mutation, a mutation that put my chances of breast cancer at 84 percent. On May 1, 2018, I followed in my mother?s footsteps, choosing to get a preventative mastectomy. As I came out of anesthesia, one of the first calls I received was from Ivanka Trump. As I recovered, my phone rang again. It was President Trump calling to check on me. I was blown away. Here was the leader of the free world caring about my circumstance.? ?I was raised in a household of all women. They were self-reliant and resilient. Their lives were not easy, but they never complained. Money was tight, but we had an abundance of what mattered most: family, faith and freedom. I learned that, in America, limited means does not make for limited dreams. The promise of America belongs to us all.? ?I wasn?t born a Trump. I?m from the South. I was raised a Carolina girl. I went to public schools and worked my way through a state university. Mrs. B. from my seventh-grade English class was right. What I learned about our president is different than what you might have heard. I learned that he?s a good man, that he loves his family, that he didn?t need this job. We cannot dare to dream our biggest dreams for ourselves or for our children while consumed by worry about the safety of our families. President Trump is the law-and-order president, from our borders to our backyards.? [music, ?Hail to the Chief?] [cheering]Mr. Pence was more explicit in drawing a connection to the Democratic nominee: ?You won?t be safe,? he said, ?in Joe Biden?s America.?Even as president, Mr. Trump has often appeared most comfortable in the role of back-seat driver, jeering his own government like a common bystander, insisting that someone really ought to do something about all this. (?When he has an opinion,? Mr. Pence said, ?he is liable to share it.?)The effect during a week like this one ? as a public health crisis proceeds apace and unrest consumes Kenosha, Wis., after another police shooting of a Black man ? is particularly jarring, all the more because Mr. Trump has also strained throughout the convention to display himself in various scenes of presidential busyness: issuing a pardon, meeting with freed hostages, presiding over a naturalization ceremony. In the process, Mr. Trump and his team have effectively ignored distinctions between campaign activity and official business ? less line-blurring than ostensible law-violating ? co-opting public resources for political gain.Through it all, the intended takeaway has seemed clear: Mr. Trump is in control of the good but not responsible for the bad, worthy of praise for America?s successes and exoneration for its struggles.In particular, Republicans are betting that images of chaos and violence will help persuade swing voters, especially in the suburbs, to embrace the president?s emphasis on ?LAW and ORDER,? as he tweeted on Wednesday.It is not entirely ?Make America Great Again,? the president?s initial political creed, which might suggest something of a failure to do so in his first term (though it remains a favored campaign saying anyway). It is not quite ?Keep America Great,? one of his newer taglines, because so much of the Republican case has centered on the present turmoil.Perhaps Mr. Pence hinted best at the awkwardness of the pitch with a recent revision to the slogan. ?We?re going to Make America Great Again, again,? he told delegates in Charlotte, N.C., on Monday and repeated on Wednesday in his convention address.If calls for national order were often the night?s central feature, several speeches seemed calibrated to appeal to women and people of faith.White evangelical Americans have been among Mr. Trump?s most loyal constituencies, and speakers constantly highlighted Mr. Trump?s opposition to abortion rights and what they described as his support for religious liberty. Some of the most prominent female voices on Wednesday, including top White House aides like Kellyanne Conway and Kayleigh McEnany, are well-regarded among evangelical and conservative Catholic women.Mindful of Mr. Trump?s polling deficit with women, convention organizers also saw to it that Wednesday?s programming positioned him as a champion for gender equality, seeing no contradiction in making this case for a man with a long trail of sexist and demeaning comments about women and multiple allegations of sexual misconduct.Several speakers, including Mr. Pence?s wife, Karen, paid tribute to the women?s suffrage movement and implied Mr. Trump was a steward of the cause. Ms. Conway and Ms. McEnany relayed choice anecdotes of Mr. Trump?s support for them professionally and personally.?I want my daughter,? Ms. McEnany said, ?to grow up in President Donald J. Trump?s America.?It is true that gauzy framing has long been a bipartisan tradition at party conventions. But often this week, Republicans have engaged in something closer to a wholesale rewriting, spinning alternate histories that assume the country?s crises have passed, Senator Bernie Sanders is their caricature-ready progressive opponent and Mr. Trump, depending on the issue, is not in a position of authority.The political decision facing Americans? It is a choice ?between the far-left Democratic socialist agenda versus protecting and preserving the American dream,? Representative Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York, said Wednesday.The coronavirus? ?It was awful,? Larry Kudlow, the president?s top economic adviser, said on Tuesday, relegating it misleadingly to the past tense and, like others this week, paying no mind to the administration?s well-documented mishandling of the pandemic, in a convention where Republicans turned blame for the costs of the virus on China.Demonstrations over racial justice? ?Make no mistake,? Patricia McCloskey, who joined her husband earlier this year in pointing guns at protesters outside their home in St. Louis, said Monday, ?no matter where you live, your family will not be safe in the radical Democrats? America.? Left unsaid: The two appear to have felt unsafe recently in a Trump-led America.Of course, Mr. Trump?s supporters have often reasoned that he cannot be blamed for what happens in ?Democrat-run cities,? as Ms. Noem put it.?Joe Biden would double down,? Mr. Pence said, ?on the very policies that are leading to violence in America?s cities.?Some Trump allies plainly see a political opportunity in the recent developments in Wisconsin, where the Democratic governor declared a state of emergency following protests that at times turned destructive, after the police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake.?We will have law and order on the streets of this country for every American of every race and creed and color,? Mr. Pence declared.Mr. Blake was paralyzed after a white officer fired on him multiple times, igniting outrage among many Americans as the latest example of police violence in a year brimming with brutal episodes. Two people were later killed in a shooting related to the demonstrations, and a white teenager who was not believed to be among the protesters was arrested and charged.As he has for months, Mr. Biden sought to walk a careful line between expressing solidarity with protesters and condemning chaos. In a video he released Wednesday, he offered a denunciation of systemic racism and urged all Americans to empathize with the pain Black parents, like Mr. Blake?s family, often face. But he also called for calm.?Burning down communities is not protest, it?s needless violence,? he said. ?Violence that endangers lives. Violence that guts businesses, and shutters businesses, that serve the community. That?s wrong.?Even before the convention, Republicans sought to cast Mr. Biden as radically anti-law enforcement, falsely claiming that he wants to defund the police, a proposal Mr. Biden has repeatedly rejected. In fact, Mr. Biden for years fashioned himself as a tough-on-crime kind of Democrat, and he played a central role in the 1994 crime bill ? a measure that many experts now associate with mass incarceration and a part of Mr. Biden?s record that gives criminal justice advocates and some progressives pause to this day. In recent months, he has called for sweeping policing reforms and spoken out passionately against police violence, but he has also made a point to emphasize his view that ?the vast majority? of police officers ?are good, decent people.?Up until this point, Mr. Trump has struggled to define Mr. Biden, lobbing an onslaught of sometimes-contradictory attacks at him all summer while remaining behind him in the polls. At one point, in the Philadelphia media market, Mr. Trump ran advertisements that portrayed Mr. Biden as both weak on law enforcement matters and overly punitive. Strands of both of those arguments have come through during his convention this week.But Mr. Trump has succeeded many times before in tarring his opponents, and Democrats acknowledge he still has time to do so with Mr. Biden before November.On Wednesday, other Republicans gave it a try.Mr. Biden, Ms. Stefanik said, represents the ?far-left failed policies of the past 47 years.?He is a Catholic ?in name only,? said Lou Holtz, the former college football coach, making a false claim about a man who regularly attends church and speaks frequently about his faith.Or perhaps, Mr. Pence said, Mr. Biden ? a man who often waxes nostalgic for the days of bipartisan dealmaking ? is actually ?a Trojan horse for the radical left.?",human
"Two weeks after George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis, demonstrations against police violence continued to fill the streets of cities and towns across the country on Monday. About 1,000 protesters gathered in Los Angeles near a memorial for those killed by the police. Thousands more called for police reforms before a City Council meeting in Charlotte, N.C. And more than 1,000 made their way to a march that began in Washington Square Park in Manhattan.?This is a young, young revolution,? said Vidal Guzman, 29, as he led marchers down Fifth Avenue in New York. ?These are teenagers, people in their 20s, 30-year-olds. We have energy. We believe in what we?re doing, and we?re not going to let up.?[Read more on the life of George Floyd.]Still, there were signs in parts of the country that the demonstrations that have raged through cities after dark over the past two weeks appeared to be ramping down in many places. By Monday night in Washington, after more than 40,000 people descended on the nation?s capital over the weekend, the city ? for the most part ? was quiet. The mouth of Lafayette Square, just yards from the White House, which had been a focal point for days of protests, was more a place of tribute than raised voices.The black chain-link fence erected last week to keep protesters out had been adorned with flowers and flags, signs and posters. ?Stop killing us,? one read. Another: ?I am not a threat.? Geoff Thiel, 24, of Washington, was still in the park after arriving on Tuesday to hand out food and water from the back of a dilapidated white Volvo. Now, he and other volunteers had a tent, foldout tables and a significantly larger inventory.Mr. Thiel opted to measure the crowd size by water bottles distributed. On Saturday: well over a thousand. Monday, he said, ?just a few hundred.?Still, with the economic devastation caused by the coronavirus giving people plenty of time to participate, activists vowed not to lose visibility or momentum. And it seemed it might only take another incident of police violence, like those seen during demonstrations across the country in recent weeks, to renew the rage.?I?ll come out day after day after day,? said Andrew Jackson, a 25-year-old government contractor who said his own experiences of police abuse had compelled him to cut back on his work hours and join rallies in Washington. While city streets have calmed throughout much of the country, the Pacific Northwest has continued to see tense nightly standoffs between demonstrators and the police. On Monday, demonstrators in Portland, Ore., began their latest march by shutting down Interstate 84, while those in Seattle moved barricades in the city?s Capitol Hill neighborhood to create a protected space.The persistent pressure from demonstrators has stirred further change in police departments. In Portland, Chief Jami Resch announced Monday that she was stepping down, saying new leadership was needed to help rebuild trust. In Seattle, police officers abandoned and boarded up their East Precinct building, which has been the center of demonstrations in the city.Both cities have vowed to limit their use of tear gas, although at a protest that lasted from Sunday night into Monday morning, the police in Seattle still ended up discharging it, saying they were being targeted with projectiles. Two City Council members have called on Seattle?s mayor, Jenny Durkan, to resign.transcript?This movement of ? moment of national anguish is being transformed into a movement of national action as Americans from across the country peacefully protest to demand an end to injustice. Today with the Justice and Policing Act, the Congress is standing with those fighting for justice and taking action.? ?The Justice and Policing Act establishes a bold transformative vision of policing in America. Never again should the world be subjected to witnessing what we saw on the streets in Minneapolis.? ?We?re here because black Americans want to stop being killed. Just last week, we couldn?t even pass an anti-lynching bill in the United States Senate. So when we look at where we are now with this piece of legislation we have to understand, yes as a country, we?ve seen great progress. But just last week in the year of our Lord 2020, we could not get an anti-lynching bill passed in the United States Senate.? ?Black people came to this country against their will ? chained, shackled ? and came to these shores enslaved, and stayed that way for 244 years. Think about how long that is, how many generations that is.?Democratic lawmakers in Congress introduced legislation on Monday aimed at ending excessive use of force by police officers across the country, and making it easier to identify, track and prosecute police misconduct. The bill was introduced as a direct response to the recent killings of unarmed black Americans by police officers, as protests against police violence and racial discrimination continue across the country. It is the most expansive intervention into policing that lawmakers have proposed in recent memory.The measure would curtail existing legal protections that shield police officers who are accused of misconduct from being prosecuted, and would impose new restrictions to prevent law enforcement officers from using deadly force, except as a last resort. It includes many proposals that civil rights activists have been pushing for decades against opposition from police unions and law enforcement groups.?Never again should the world be subjected to witnessing what we saw on the streets in Minneapolis, the slow murder of an individual by a uniformed police officer,? said Representative Karen Bass, the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus. She was joined by Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, and Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California in introducing the measure. Immediately beforehand, the four lawmakers joined with Democratic leaders to honor George Floyd, a black man who was killed while being arrested by Minneapolis police. They kneeled for 8 minutes 46 seconds, the length of time an officer pressed his knee on Mr. Floyd?s neck.Whether Democrats can seize the moment and push the changes into law remains unclear. They expect to pass the legislation swiftly in the Democratic-led House, but President Trump and Republican lawmakers who control the Senate have yet to signal which measures, if any, they would accept.Mr. Trump has said little about the issue in recent days except to show his support for law and order on Twitter. In an interview with Fox News on Monday, Attorney General William P. Barr reiterated his view that police departments do not have a systemic problem with race.Mr. Barr said that to draw conclusions about all police officers based on the actions of a few is akin to drawing conclusions about all black people based on negative stereotypes, which he called ?one of the legitimate grievances of the African-American community.?In the interview, Mr. Barr also contradicted Mr. Trump?s claim that he had visited a White House bunker for an inspection during the protests following Mr. Floyd?s death. ?Things were so bad that the Secret Service recommended the president go down to the bunker,? Mr. Barr said. ?We can?t have that in our country.?Democrats in Congress will discuss their bill and hear testimony on police brutality and racial profiling at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday. Among those set to testify is Philonise Floyd, a brother of George Floyd, according to a committee official familiar with the plans. The committee had yet to announce other witnesses.transcriptIt?s a Monday evening in Minneapolis. Police respond to a call about a man who allegedly used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. Seventeen minutes later, the man they are there to investigate lies motionless on the ground, and is pronounced dead shortly after. The man was 46-year-old George Floyd, a bouncer originally from Houston who had lost his job at a restaurant when the coronavirus pandemic hit. Crowd: ?No justice, no peace.? Floyd?s death triggered major protests in Minneapolis, and sparked rage across the country. One of the officers involved, Derek Chauvin, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder. The other three officers have been charged with aiding and abetting murder. The Times analyzed bystander videos, security camera footage and police scanner audio, spoke to witnesses and experts, and reviewed documents released by the authorities to build as comprehensive a picture as possible and better understand how George Floyd died in police custody. The events of May 25 begin here. Floyd is sitting in the driver?s seat of this blue S.U.V. Across the street is a convenience store called Cup Foods. Footage from this restaurant security camera helps us understand what happens next. Note that the timestamp on the camera is 24 minutes fast. At 7:57 p.m., two employees from Cup Foods confront Floyd and his companions about an alleged counterfeit bill he just used in their store to buy cigarettes. They demand the cigarettes back but walk away empty-handed. Four minutes later, they call the police. According to the 911 transcript, an employee says that Floyd used fake bills to buy cigarettes, and that he is ?awfully drunk? and ?not in control of himself.? Soon, the first police vehicle arrives on the scene. Officers Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng step out of the car and approach the blue S.U.V. Seconds later, Lane pulls his gun. We don?t know exactly why. He orders Floyd to put his hands on the wheel. Lane reholsters the gun, and after about 90 seconds of back and forth, yanks Floyd out of the S.U.V. A man is filming the confrontation from a car parked behind them. The officers cuff Floyd?s hands behind his back. And Kueng walks him to the restaurant wall. ?All right, what?s your name?? From the 911 transcript and the footage, we now know three important facts: First, that the police believed they were responding to a man who was drunk and out of control. But second, even though the police were expecting this situation, we can see that Floyd has not acted violently. And third, that he seems to already be in distress. Six minutes into the arrest, the two officers move Floyd back to their vehicle. As the officers approach their car, we can see Floyd fall to the ground. According to the criminal complaints filed against the officers, Floyd says he is claustrophobic and refuses to enter the police car. During the struggle, Floyd appears to turn his head to address the officers multiple times. According to the complaints, he tells them he can?t breathe. Nine minutes into the arrest, the third and final police car arrives on the scene. It?s carrying officers Tou Thao and Derek Chauvin. Both have previous records of complaints brought against them. Thao was once sued for throwing a man to the ground and hitting him. Chauvin has been involved in three police shootings, one of them fatal. Chauvin becomes involved in the struggle to get Floyd into the car. Security camera footage from Cup Foods shows Kueng struggling with Floyd in the backseat while Thao watches. Chauvin pulls him through the back seat and onto the street. We don?t know why. Floyd is now lying on the pavement, face down. That?s when two witnesses begin filming, almost simultaneously. The footage from the first witness shows us that all four officers are now gathered around Floyd. It?s the first moment when we can clearly see that Floyd is face down on the ground, with three officers applying pressure to his neck, torso and legs. At 8:20 p.m., we hear Floyd?s voice for the first time. The video stops when Lane appears to tell the person filming to walk away. ?Get off to the sidewalk, please. One side or the other, please.? The officers radio a Code 2, a call for non-emergency medical assistance, reporting an injury to Floyd?s mouth. In the background, we can hear Floyd struggling. The call is quickly upgraded to a Code 3, a call for emergency medical assistance. By now another bystander, 17-year-old Darnella Frazier, is filming from a different angle. Her footage shows that despite calls for medical help, Chauvin keeps Floyd pinned down for another seven minutes. We can?t see whether Kueng and Lane are still applying pressure. Floyd: [gasping] Officer: ?What do you want?? Bystander: ?I?ve been ?? Floyd: [gasping] In the two videos, Floyd can be heard telling officers that he can?t breathe at least 16 times in less than five minutes. Bystander: ?You having fun?? But Chauvin never takes his knee off of Floyd, even as his eyes close and he appears to go unconscious. Bystander: ?Bro.? According to medical and policing experts, these four police officers are committing a series of actions that violate policies, and in this case, turn fatal. They?ve kept Floyd lying face down, applying pressure for at least five minutes. This combined action is likely compressing his chest and making it impossible to breathe. Chauvin is pushing his knee into Floyd?s neck, a move banned by most police departments. Minneapolis Police Department policy states an officer can only do this if someone is, quote, ?actively resisting.? And even though the officers call for medical assistance, they take no action to treat Floyd on their own while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. Officer: ?Get back on the sidewalk.? According to the complaints against the officers, Lane asks him twice if they should roll Floyd onto his side. Chauvin says no. Twenty minutes into the arrest, an ambulance arrives on the scene. Bystander: ?Get off of his neck!? Bystander: ?He?s still on him?? The E.M.T.s check Floyd?s pulse. Bystander: ?Are you serious?? Chauvin keeps his knee on Floyd?s neck for almost another whole minute, even though Floyd appears completely unresponsive. He only gets off once the E.M.T.s tell him to. Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd?s neck for over eight minutes, according to our review of the video evidence. Floyd is loaded into the ambulance. The ambulance leaves the scene, possibly because a crowd is forming. But the E.M.T.s call for additional medical help from the fire department. But when the engine arrives, the officers give them, quote, ?no clear info on Floyd or his whereabouts,? according to a fire department incident report. This delays their ability to help the paramedics. Meanwhile, Floyd is going into cardiac arrest. It takes the engine five minutes to reach Floyd in the ambulance. He?s pronounced dead at a nearby hospital around 9:25 p.m. Preliminary autopsies conducted by the state and Floyd?s family both ruled his death a homicide. The widely circulated arrest videos don?t paint the entire picture of what happened to George Floyd. Crowd: ?Floyd! Floyd!? Additional video and audio from the body cameras of the key officers would reveal more about why the struggle began and how it escalated. The city quickly fired all four officers. And Chauvin has been charged with second degree murder. Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao were charged with aiding and abetting murder. But outrage over George Floyd?s death has only spread further and further across the United States.Bail was set on Monday at up to $1.25 million for Derek Chauvin, the white former Minneapolis police officer charged with murder in the killing of George Floyd, a black man whose death in custody led to nationwide protests.In the initial hearing in his case at the heavily fortified Hennepin County courthouse, the former officer, Derek Chauvin, a 19-year veteran of the police force, participated through a video feed from jail. Mr. Chauvin, who has been behind bars since he was arrested on May 29, faces charges of second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He faces up to 40 years in prison.In a video that prompted anguish and outrage across the nation, Mr. Chauvin was seen pressing his knee on the neck of Mr. Floyd for nearly nine minutes. He has become a focus of global anger, referred to as the most hated man in the world. Activists said they were concerned that he would not abide by bail restrictions if he was permitted to go home while awaiting trial.Mr. Chauvin?s bail would be $1 million if he agrees to certain conditions, including surrendering any firearms he has, remaining in the state until trial, not working in law enforcement and avoiding any contact with the Floyd family. The bail set for Mr. Chauvin is significantly higher than the bail of at least $750,000 given last week to the three other former officers accused of aiding and abetting in Mr. Floyd?s death.A lawyer for Mr. Chauvin declined to comment.Mr. Chauvin?s record at the police department was mixed. He was the subject of at least 17 misconduct complaints over two decades, according to a heavily redacted version of his personnel file that included no details on most of those complaints. He was also given at least two medals of valor. Two weeks after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, massive gatherings for racial justice around the country have achieved a scale and level of momentum not seen in decades ? and they appear unlikely to run out anytime soon as a number of societal forces propel the movement forward.Many people filling the streets say the economic devastation of the coronavirus had already cleared their schedules. With jobs lost and colleges shuttered, they have nothing but time. And aggressive responses by the police at protests are only reinforcing their commitment.?You?re watching injustice take place in every sector of our society,? said Wes Moore, who chronicled the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore and its aftermath in the book ?Five Days.? ?Schools have been closed. Students are burdened and under debt. There?s a compounding to the pain.?The sustained outcry has already led to stark promises for change in several cities, as calls to defund, downsize or abolish police departments gain new traction. In Minneapolis, where Mr. Floyd was killed on May 25, nine of 13 City Council members publicly promised on Sunday to dismantle the Police Department and create a new system of public safety. Though Mayor Jacob Frey has expressed reservations, the council members said they had enough votes to override any potential veto. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio pledged to cut the city?s police budget and spend more on social services. The mayor did not say how much funding he planned to divert to social services from the New York Police Department, whose annual $6 billion budget represents more than 6 percent of Mr. de Blasio?s proposed $90 billion budget. Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles also announced last week that he would cut as much as $150 million from a planned increase in the Police Department?s budget.Attorney General William P. Barr spoke against reducing police budgets in an interview with Fox News on Monday.?I think defunding the police, holding the entire police structure responsible for the actions of certain officers, is wrong,? Mr. Barr said. ?I think it is dangerous to demonize police.?He called the nation?s 900,000 police officers ?generally speaking excellent,? and said that the nation would see ?chaos? and ?more killings? should any major city disband its department. Asked by CBS?s Norah O?Donnell on Monday if he supported defunding the police, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. answered: ?No, I don?t support defunding the police. I support conditioning federal aid to police based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness.?It was the first time Mr. Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, had weighed in on the growing calls for some existing police forces to be dismantled or pared down. His stance puts him at odds with some on the left of his party, who want to shrink police budgets and make radical changes in law enforcement. Earlier in the day, a Biden campaign spokesman, Andrew Bates, said Mr. Biden ?hears and shares the deep grief and frustration of those calling out for change? and ?supports the urgent need for reform.? But Mr. Bates emphasized that Mr. Biden believes providing funding is necessary to help improve policing, including by supporting ?community policing programs that improve relationships between officers and residents.?Mr. Biden traveled to Houston on Monday to meet with the family of George Floyd, whose killing in Minneapolis sparked widespread protests over police brutality and racism in America.?Listening to one another is what will begin to heal America,? Benjamin Crump, the lawyer working with Mr. Floyd?s family, wrote on Twitter after the meeting. Days of protests against police brutality have prompted numerous incidents of police misconduct, many of them captured on video and spread online. Now, more are coming to light.The Minnesota state government acknowledged on Monday that Minneapolis police officers punctured the tires of parked cars near demonstrations in the city on May 30 and 31, saying that it was a legitimate police tactic because cars were being used to attack protesters and law enforcement officers.Mother Jones reported the tire-slashing by the police on Saturday, with video clips of officers jabbing the tires of cars.It was not clear how the officers chose which cars to disable, how many vehicles were affected, or whether those whose tires were slashed, including journalists, would be compensated.In Philadelphia on Monday, a veteran police inspector who was seen on video beating a Temple University student in the head with a baton at a protest last week turned himself in, while dozens of officers turned out to applaud him in support. The police union, which condemned the charges as baseless, has been selling T-shirts to support the inspector.Also on Monday, the Buffalo Police Department announced that it had suspended a civilian employee for a ?reprehensible social media post.? Local media identified the employee as a police dispatcher who called protesters ?wild animals? on Facebook and urged the city?s mayor to ?allow the officers to shoot to kill.?The suspension comes days after two Buffalo police officers in a riot control unit were charged with felony assault after a video showed them shoving a 75-year-old protester to the ground. In a gesture of support for their suspended colleagues, all 57 members of the unit quit the team, although they remained on the police force.A 23-year-old man has been charged in connection with the fire that gutted a Minneapolis police station, after he was arrested while wearing gear stolen from the station, federal prosecutors said.Branden M. Wolfe, of St. Paul, faces a charge of aiding and abetting arson on the night of May 28, when a protest over the death of George Floyd turned violent and the Third Precinct station was looted and burned.Six days later, police officers in St. Paul arrested Mr. Wolfe after receiving a call of a man wearing body armor and wielding a police baton who was trying to get into a home improvement store. According to a statement from the United States attorney?s office in Minneapolis, store employees told the officers that Mr. Wolfe had worked there as a security guard, but had been fired that day after talking about stealing items from the police station.?At the time of the arrest, Wolfe was wearing multiple items stolen from the Third Precinct, including body armor, a police-issue duty belt with handcuffs, an earphone piece, baton, and knife,? the statement said, adding that he had written his name in duct tape on the back of the body armor.Officers later recovered other items of Minneapolis Police Department property from his apartment, the statement said, ?including a riot helmet, 9mm pistol magazine, police radio, and police issue overdose kit.?Mr. Wolfe admitted to law enforcement officers that he had taken items from the precinct station the night it was attacked, and had rolled a wooden barrel into a fire there to help keep it burning, the federal prosecutors said. They added that he also identified himself in multiple photos taken that night, showing him in front of the burning building, holding a police baton.transcriptOh, God. Oh my God! Oh my God! Look out. Oh no! There?s a gun. There?s a gun. Jesus Christ. Oh, God. They have a gun. He?s got a gun. He?s got a gun. Oh, God. Oh my God. Oh, no. Oh, God. Oh, God. What happened? Car drove in, here. He got out, flashed a gun ?In separate incidents on Sunday near Richmond, Va., and in Seattle, people tried to drive their cars into demonstrations and were arrested, the authorities said ? the latest in a series of similar attacks on people protesting the death of George Floyd.The man who drove into a group of protesters in Virginia identified himself as a leader of the Ku Klux Klan, the authorities said, and prosecutors said they were investigating the episode as a possible hate crime.?Several witnesses reported that a vehicle revved their engine and drove through the protesters occupying the roadway,? the Henrico County Police Division said in a statement.The driver, Harry H. Rogers, 36, of Hanover County, Va., was arrested and charged with assault and battery, the police said. There were no reports of serious injuries, the police said.?The accused, by his own admission and by a cursory glance at social media, is an admitted leader of the Ku Klux Klan and a propagandist for Confederate ideology,? said Shannon L. Taylor, the Commonwealth?s Attorney for Henrico County. ?We are investigating whether hate crimes charges are appropriate.?A lawyer for Mr. Rogers could not immediately be reached for comment. It was unclear whether Mr. Rogers?s claims about his membership in the Ku Klux Klan were true.In the incident in Seattle, part of it captured on video, a man, whose name has not been released, drove into a group of protesters, some of whom pounded on his car. The man shot and wounded one demonstrator, got out of his car brandishing a gun, then left on foot through the crowd and surrendered to officers, the police said.A man who drove through a group of demonstrators in Brooklyn over the weekend was also arrested.IBM will no longer be a supplier of facial recognition technology used for surveillance by the police, Arvind Krishna, the company?s chief executive, wrote in a letter to Congress on Monday.Mr. Krishna, who became IBM?s chief executive in April, portrayed the company?s position as a stand of principle and urged other technology companies to adopt the same policy. In his letter to Congress, Mr. Krishna said IBM ?firmly opposes? the use of technology supplied by any company for mass surveillance or racial profiling.The move by IBM is a significant symbolic step. The company has been active in facial recognition technology research as one branch of its work in the field of artificial intelligence. But it is not a major product for the company. Still, IBM has a long history of working closely with law enforcement agencies, going back decades to the development CompStat systems used to gather information and analyze crime trends. In recent years, it has developed technology for what it has marketed as ?predictive policing.?transcript[music] ?Well we called him ?Big Floyd.? Everybody ? his name is George, but we called him ?Big Floyd.? Man he was just a gentle giant, man, humble person. Like I said, he?d give you the shirt off his back if you needed it, whatever you wanted, man he?d give it to you. He was inspirational, kept everybody laughing. He was just a joyful spirit. And it?s just hard to see the incident happen to him. But I think it was for a better purpose because he is spreading the word all over the world. It?s actually bigger than him, right now.? ?His death wasn?t in vain. You know, he definitely started a movement that it was about time. And I just ? it felt really, just emotional to see him. And I just wanted to give my condolences, and I also felt proud that, you know, his death, it?s changed the world.?Houston mourned for George Floyd at a public viewing on Monday that stretched for more than six hours and became not so much a rally or a protest but an open-air memorial for a city?s fallen son.Because of coronavirus precautions, only a few mourners at a time were allowed inside the Fountain of Praise church. Many wore masks, including some emblazoned with Mr. Floyd?s anguished cry, ?I can?t breathe.? The majority were African-American, but there was a diversity in the crowd ? one young white man held a bouquet of flowers as he stood in line. People held umbrellas, waved fans and sat in a cooling tent as the heat and humidity soaked faces and shirts.?I?m going to wait in line all day if it?s necessary,? said Charles Edward Jackson, 70, a retired bus driver.From noon to the end of the service shortly after 6 p.m., nearly 6,400 people walked past Mr. Floyd?s coffin, said a spokeswoman for Fort Bend Memorial Planning Center, the funeral home handling the arrangements.Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, who met later with the Floyd family privately inside the church, was among the first to pay his respects.?This is the most horrific tragedy I?ve ever personally observed,? Governor Abbott, a Republican, said of Mr. Floyd?s death in police custody. ?George Floyd is going to change the arc of the future of the United States. George Floyd has not died in vain.? Carol Wright, 48, wiped tears from her eyes as she left the church.?I wasn?t expecting the casket to be open, so that kind of caught me,? said Ms. Wright, an information technology consultant from the Houston suburb of Katy. ?I was thinking about him calling for his mother and thinking about so many black men I know that age.?The white police chief in Portland, Ore., announced that she was resigning from her leadership position on Monday and that she had asked a black lieutenant to replace her. The move comes after days of protests and chaos in the largely white, liberal city of 650,000. ?Over the last 10 days, I?ve watched our city, I?ve listened, and I hear you,? the outgoing chief, Jami Resch, said at a news conference. ?I have asked our community time and time again, what do we need to do? And each time we hear them say, ?Show us change.??Ms. Resch, a veteran of the department who had served as chief for less than six months, said she would remain on the police force in an undetermined capacity. ?To say this is unexpected would be an understatement,? her successor, Charles Lovell, said at the news conference. Chief Lovell praised Ms. Resch as a ?selfless, caring leader? who wanted to do what was right for the community. He also directly addressed the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, whose fatal encounter with the police was captured on video that has driven two weeks of anger and demands for change nationwide. ?As I watched the agonizing minutes tick by, it wasn?t the tactics, it wasn?t the number of officers there,? he said. ?It was really the lack of care and compassion.??It almost felt like, ?You?re not important,?? he added. He promised to fight against that idea in his police force and his city. While tensions have eased in the last few days between protesters and police in many cities, Portland has continued to see confrontations, with officers repeatedly using tear gas to disperse demonstrators.Reporting was contributed by Mike Baker, Kim Barker, Katie Benner, Chris Cameron, Helene Cooper, Nick Cumming-Bruce, John Eligon, Nicholas Fandos, Jacey Fortin, Tess Felder, Manny Fernandez, Thomas Gibbons-Neff, Katie Glueck, Adam Goldman, Russell Goldman, Jack Healy, Lara Jakes, Zolan Kanno-Youngs, Thomas Kaplan, Eric Killelea, Mark Landler, Dan Levin, Steve Lohr, Constant Meheut, Sarah Mervosh, Richard Perez-Pena, Aaron Randle, Katie Rogers, Dana Rubinstein, Marc Santora, Eric Schmitt, Dionne Searcey, Ashley Southall and Farah Stockman.",human
"President Trump made only a glancing reference to Kenosha, Wis., in his speech on Thursday accepting the Republican nomination for a second term, linking it to other American cities where protests against systemic racism and police brutality have sometimes turned violent.Mr. Trump?s mention of Kenosha, the scene of several chaotic nights of demonstrations this week, and the other cities was shorthand for what he claims is a creeping lawlessness that will blanket the United States if his Democratic opponent, Joseph R. Biden Jr., is elected.But, like Vice President Mike Pence, who hit the same theme on Wednesday, Mr. Trump did not say what touched off the unrest in Kenosha: the shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, by a white police officer in an episode that has drawn widespread condemnation and is being investigated by state authorities and the Justice Department.?When there is police misconduct, the justice system must hold wrongdoers fully and completely accountable, and it will,? Mr. Trump said, without citing specific examples of such misconduct. ?But we can never have a situation where things are going on as they are today, we must never allow mob rule. We can never allow mob rule. ?He continued: ?In the strongest possible terms the Republican Party condemns the rioting, looting, arson and violence we have seen in Democrat-run cities all, like Kenosha, Minneapolis, Portland, Chicago and New York, many others, Democrat-run.?Mr. Trump?s election four years ago was aided by his narrow victory in Wisconsin, and he won Kenosha County by fewer than 250 votes. Some local Democrats have said the violence that flared amid the Kenosha protests could lift his re-election prospects.The New York Mets and Miami Marlins chose not to play their scheduled game on Thursday, joining 12 other Major League Baseball teams that sat out their games as part of a wave of sports protests over the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis. Before the decision was formalized, Brodie Van Wagenen, the Mets? general manager, was captured on video delivering a searing critique of Commissioner Rob Manfred that he later retracted in a written apology.?At the leadership level, he doesn?t get it,? Van Wagenen said of Manfred, in a video feed the Mets use for Zoom news conferences that appeared to have been accidentally broadcast online. Van Wagenen?s comments came as he spoke with two unidentified people who were not visible in the video about a proposal for the Mets and Marlins to stage a walkout at the game?s scheduled start time and to then return to the filed and start play an hour later. Van Wagenen said he thought it was Manfred?s plan, but it had actually come from his boss, Jeff Wilpon, the Mets? chief operating officer.Van Wagenen said Wilpon had called Manfred to tell him the players had voted not to play, and the two had discussed the difficulty of rescheduling the game, since the teams are not supposed to meet again this season. Wilpon proposed the delayed start, irritating Van Wagenen.?The players had already made their decision so I felt the suggestion was not helpful,? Van Wagenen said in his subsequent statement. ?My frustration with the commissioner was wrong and unfounded. I apologize to the commissioner for my disrespectful comments and poor judgment in inaccurately describing the contents of his private conversation with Jeff Wilpon.?In the end, the Mets? starters took the field at game time as the other players on both teams stood in foul territory for 42 seconds of silence in a nod to Jackie Robinson, who wore No. 42 and broke baseball?s color barrier in 1947. The players then retreated to their clubhouses for the night, leaving a ?Black Lives Matter? T-shirt draped across home plate.Residents sat in lawn chairs in driveways and on porches. They watched cars roll up, pause at a stop sign and then drive on. The only reminder that something significant had happened at the quiet corner was a silver sedan parked on the side of the street with its windows busted out. This was the intersection where Jacob Blake, a Black man, had been shot by a white police officer, Rusten Sheskey, on Sunday, inciting the kind of widespread protests and wanton destruction that a small lakeside community like Kenosha, Wis., had never seen. By Thursday, some of the tension of earlier in the week appeared to be continuing to fade after what had been a relatively quiet Wednesday night. The most disruptive thing in town seemed to be stores closing early because of a 7 p.m. curfew. Many residents tugged on the locked doors of gas stations and pharmacies before walking away in frustration.After the curfew arrived, a small group milled around a town square in front of the county courthouse. Marchers had taken a few laps through the city on Wednesday night, but the scene was calm. Earlier in the week, the square had been the scene of raucous clashes between protesters and the police. By Thursday, the intersection where Mr. Blake was shot was just an intersection again.Local residents said they remained resolute in wanting to continue to push for change, but they also lamented the destruction of some of the city?s businesses.?That?s a different crowd,? Sharice Coleman, 23, a Kenosha native said of those who had rioted. People like her, she said, were in the streets out to advocate for change.Although things might have quieted down on Wednesday and Thursday, there were major rallies planned in Kenosha for Friday and Saturday. The event on Saturday is expected to include Mr. Blake?s family, who say he was left paralyzed by the shooting. Prosecutors on Thursday charged a 17-year-old with killing two protesters and wounding a third in Kenosha, Wis., on Tuesday, filing several homicide-related counts against him and laying out what they say happened on the chaotic night of the shootings.The teenager, Kyle H. Rittenhouse, of Antioch, Ill., was accused in a criminal complaint of first-degree intentional homicide in the death of Anthony M. Huber, the most serious of the charges; first-degree reckless homicide in the death of Joseph D. Rosenbaum, and attempted first-degree intentional homicide in the shooting of Gaige P. Grosskreutz.In one of several videos of the shootings that is cited in the complaint, prosecutors said that Mr. Rittenhouse can be heard saying ?I just killed somebody? into his cellphone amid the shootings on Tuesday. Under Wisconsin law, a 17-year-old defendant is charged as an adult. Mr. Rittenhouse faces a potential life sentence if he is convicted of first-degree intentional homicide and up to 60 years in prison if he is found guilty of first-degree reckless homicide, according to the complaint, which was filed in Circuit Court by the office of the Kenosha County district attorney, Michael Gravely.In the narrative laid out in the complaint, Mr. Rosenbaum, 36, threw a plastic bag at and approached Mr. Rittenhouse, who responded by firing several shots from a Smith & Wesson AR-15-style rifle. The complaint quotes a witness saying that Mr. Rosenbaum, who was fatally wounded, had tried to grab the gun.From there, according to the complaint, a chaotic scene unfolded, with Mr. Rittenhouse running through the Kenosha streets in the middle of the night, chased at time by people who yelled for someone to stop him as he continued to fire shots before falling to the ground.In the videos, the complaint says, Mr. Huber, a skateboard in his hand, can be seen approaching Mr. Rittenhouse as he lay on the ground.?Huber appears to be trying to pull the gun away from the defendant,? the complaint says. Mr. Rittenhouse rolled away from Mr. Huber and fired one round at him, the complaint says. ?Huber staggers away, taking several steps, then collapses to the ground.? A coroner?s examination showed that the bullet penetrated Mr. Huber?s heart, aorta, pulmonary artery and right lung, the complaint says. At that point Mr. Grosskreutz, his hands in the air, approached Mr. Rittenhouse, who was by then in a sitting position. Mr. Rittenhouse shot Mr. Grosskreutz in the arm, the complaint says.The coroner found that Mr. Rosenbaum was shot several times, including a shot in the back that perforated his right lung and liver, the complaint says. The N.H.L. and its players? union agreed on Thursday to postpone playoff games scheduled for Thursday and Friday, to protest the shooting of a Black man by a white police officer in Kenosha, Wis.The move came as the N.B.A. extended its shutdown, which began on Wednesday when a walkout by Milwaukee Bucks players quickly spread to other teams and other major sports, to a second day.N.B.A. players have pledged in talks with team owners to resume the season, according to two people who were part of the discussions and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the negotiations were still underway. When teams might return to the court and how the missed games might be rescheduled remained unclear. ?We are hopeful to resume games either Friday or Saturday,? Mike Bass, the league?s executive vice president, said in a statement. The N.B.A. has a large proportion of Black players, some of whom are known for speaking out on systemic racism, police violence and other social issues. The N.H.L. has few Black players, but the league and the players association, in a joint statement, said they stood in solidarity with those who have been protesting the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha ?Black and brown communities continue to face real, painful experiences,? they said.They added, ?We understand that the tragedies involving Jacob Blake, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others require us to recognize this moment.?Athletes from the W.N.B.A., Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer and the professional tennis tour also sat out games and matches on Wednesday, escalating a season of demonstrations for social justice.The W.N.B.A. postponed three games scheduled for Thursday evening as players ?continue discussions and reflections on recent events,? the league said in a statement. It was not clear when the games would be played.In the tennis world, matches at the Western & Southern Open, which is being played in New York, were suspended on Thursday, organizers said, with matches for men and women set to resume on Friday.Naomi Osaka, the winner of two Grand Slam titles, said on Wednesday that she would sit out the tournament?s semifinals to protest racial injustice. But on Thursday she had decided to participate after tennis officials agreed to move the matches to Friday.?They offered to postpone all matches until Friday, and in my mind that brings more attention to the movement,? Osaka said, adding that she was, and remained, prepared to concede her match to Elise Mertens.Anthony Huber, one of men who was killed amid the protests in Kenosha, Wis., on Tuesday was friendly with Jacob Blake, a member of the dead man?s family said.Susan Hughes, Mr. Huber?s great-aunt, said he had been drawn to the protests because he knew Mr. Blake. Mr. Huber, an avid skateboarder, rode his board to the protest on Tuesday, distressed by what had happened to Mr. Blake and by the way he had been disparaged online.Mr. Blake, who is Black, is paralyzed, according to family members. The officer who shot him, who has been identified as Rusten Sheskey, is white, as was Mr. Huber, 26.Kyle Rittenhouse, who has been charged with fatally shooting Mr. Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum, is a white 17-year-old who drove to Kenosha from Illinois armed with an AR-15-style rifle. Ms. Hughes described Mr. Huber as an intellectually curious man who enjoyed reading about philosophy and Buddhism. Mr. Huber was open about having bipolar disorder Ms. Hughes said, and he had been in and out of jail since he was a teenager, over incidents she attributed to an persistent family dispute. Once, Ms. Hughes said, Mr. Huber convinced a prison library to add a section of graphic novels, supplying the librarian with a list of titles to get started.?It?s just such a waste,? Ms. Hughes said. ?He was always one of the smartest people in the room.?Things had been looking up for Mr. Huber, Ms. Hughes said: He was working temp jobs several days a week and he had a girlfriend. Last week, he passed his driving test and received a driver?s license for the first time. His birthday was on Friday.His girlfriend, Hannah Gittings, described Mr. Huber as ?amazing? in an emotional speech to demonstrators who gathered near where he was shot on Wednesday.The other shooting victim, Mr. Rosenbaum, 36, was originally from Waco, Texas, and had a 2-year-old daughter, his sister told The Chicago Sun-Times. Efforts to reach his family on Thursday were not successful.Major League Soccer and the National Women?s Soccer League said Thursday that would investigate Dell Loy Hansen, the billionaire owner of Real Salt Lake the Utah Royals, after a published report that he had made racist comments to players, agents and team officials.The announcements came after Hansen criticized the decision by Real Salt Lake players to join a wave of team walkouts on Wednesday night.In an article published Thursday by The Athletic, a former Real Salt Lake scout, a player agent and a former Real Salt Lake player made on-the-record accusations against Hansen, who has owned a controlling interest in the team since 2013. The former scout said Hansen had joked about suggesting he ?lynch? a rival player who had scored against Real Salt Lake. The other men said Hansen had used racial slurs in their presence.?We are deeply concerned about the allegations made in a report published this evening concerning language used by and the conduct of Real Salt Lake owner Dell Loy Hansen,? M.L.S. said in a statement. The N.W.S.L., announcing its investigation, calling the comments attributed to Hansen ?shocking? and saying it would ?take all appropriate actions? if they were substantiated.The Athletic article came only hours after Hansen gave an interview in which he criticized his team?s decision not to play on Wednesday as disrespectful to him.?It?s like somebody stabbed you and you?re trying to figure out a way to pull the knife out and move forward,? Hansen said. Tziarra King, a rookie forward on the Royals who is Black, called Hansen?s comments ?completely unacceptable? in a series of Twitter posts.Hours before three protesters were shot in Kenosha, Wis., late Tuesday, calls went out on social media for armed vigilantes to flock to the city and to use force against demonstrators who were described as thugs and arsonists, according to a group that monitors internet disinformation.?The seeds of potential violence were planted over the course of the day,? the Atlantic Council?s Digital Forensic Research Lab said in a blog post on Wednesday, ?as multiple threads on Facebook and Reddit encouraged militiamen and other armed individuals to head to Kenosha, ostensibly to protect local businesses from protesters.?The group added: ?In some cases, these discussions encouraged acts of violence. The conspiracy website InfoWars, meanwhile, amplified the call to arms, potentially encouraging additional people with weapons to attend the event.?A 17-year-old, Kyle Rittenhouse, has been charged in the shootings, two of which were fatal.In an interview on Tuesday night before the shootings, Mr. Rittenhouse told a video editor at The Daily Caller, a conservative news and opinion site, that he and other armed people were present because protecting businesses was ?our job.?On the day of the shooting, the Atlantic Council researchers found, a Facebook page was created, calling for people to ?gear up? and protect Kenosha. One person posted on the page, which has since been deleted, ?shoot to kill.?Another now-deleted Facebook page, claiming to represent a local militia group, asked people to ?take up arms? and to defend Kenosha from ?evil thugs? who were ?planning on the next part of the City to burn.? The message was promoted by Infowars, and then repeated on hundreds of other Facebook pages.One person who posted in a Reddit discussion thread wrote that 75 people were on their way to Kenosha from Green Bay, Wis., adding: ?We have lots of guns. Lots of pipe bombs.? Another Reddit commenter demanded that ?all nonwhites and degenerates leave Kenosha.?Facebook has removed Mr. Rittenhouse?s accounts on that network and Instagram, removed praise for him on other accounts and blocked searches for his name, said Brian Fishman, the company?s director of Counterterrorism and Dangerous Organizations.In a Twitter thread, Mr. Fishman said that Facebook had also removed the account of the militia group for violating the company?s rules, but that it had found no evidence Mr. Rittenhouse had seen the group?s posts.Reporting was contributed by Alan Blinder, Michael Cooper, John Eligon, Jacey Fortin, Ruth Graham, Tyler Kepner, Sarah Mervosh, Richard Perez-Pe¤a, Ed Shanahan, Marc Stein, Neil Vigdor and Alan Yuhas.",human

"Andrew McCarthy: Defund the police? Here's what Dems, BLM ignoring about crime, have to say about it, but that's about.

JUAN GONZ?LEZ: This is from Politico's new show. These numbers don't seem to touch on a great deal of their stuff ? a lot.

PETER FERRELL: It's a really terrible estimate.

JUAN GONZ?LEZ: Just let people watch. I'd like to go to another area of data. You mentioned that you've got more.

PETER FERRELL: The way I look at it, a big chunk of what I've just shown in these numbers is that police over the last four years have done exactly the exact opposite and have really committed a crime to their officers who have committed it against their own people ? they have failed to stop them. And they have been criminally prosecuted and convicted, if you call them a crime, for breaking the law, then they actually have no criminal record or a felony conviction.

JUAN GONZ?LEZ: That's John D. Rockefeller.

PETER FERRELL: John D. Rockefeller?

John D. Rockefeller: Yeah. I think in the last three years as you've seen what happened to police officers, they have been prosecuted or exonerated and have been imprisoned.

JUAN GONZ?LEZ: That's John D. Rockefeller. A few months ago, the NRA released a statement condemning the police over the last couple of years, which was in its most recent quarter anniversary but this week it said the arrests were largely the result of excessive force.

John D. Rockefeller: I was one of the very first victims of excessive force. I took the law-enforcement officer who was involved with that situation, the lieutenant who was involved with it. I took an officer off the force and said ""You know, do the cops make the police officers themselves,"" and I would take that case in my whole career. I believe one thing is clear ? I think one thing is clear but I don't know what is going on with cops from a police officer, from an officer from the local police department to a police officer in a local emergency department.

JUAN GONZ?LEZ: Did police departments keep that statement?

PETER FERRELL: No. And this is a very serious point.

JUAN GONZ?LEZ: John D. Rockefeller, can you talk to any of us in the community?

PETER FERRELL: Well, I think we just started a dialogue. People who are concerned that the police are going to get killed ?

JUAN GONZ?LEZ: John D. Rockefeller?

JUAN GONZ?LEZ: John D. Rockefeller, thank you. I just want to go back to my original story. I think I would like to get a second transcript of that and to just clarify that I don't know a lot about law enforcement.

PETER FERRELL: I think I'm only going to discuss one thing. I think we need to talk about justice and it's happening in some communities in some areas that need to get rid of the officers that the police have been using. I think police are working harder. I think I don't know the specifics of what happened, but I understand why police departments are going into the cases when a law enforcement officer can be caught off guard and then they have to justify his actions.

JUAN GONZ?LEZ: John D. Rockefeller, first off, do you think it is appropriate for the people of Ferguson to be involved in domestic violence?

JUAN GONZ?LEZ: It's right. We just have a very active and dedicated community in Ferguson that we're looking for to get rid of, to give attention to, and to support, all the people of Ferguson. We're looking for them to do their work. So I want to say there to folks that are concerned that there's going to be too much crime ? that there's going to be too little funding to them ? and there has to be a lot of accountability done by the police departments. We just haven't figured out a way to get rid of that.

JUAN GONZ?LEZ: John D. Rockefeller. I want to go to an earlier point. Your article makes quite clear that you oppose the use of the police force for violence against the people of Ferguson and here in Virginia, that, by saying that police officers over the last years have been given undue or excessive force, you don't say that police officers over the last decades have been given unnecessary or excessive force, is a line you simply can't cross. You're calling for an independent investigation. The police have been given the right to go after people ?

"Lawmakers Begin Bipartisan Push to Cut Off Police Access to Military-Style Gear

John Lewis, an attorney and former prosecutor from Virginia, said the Defense Department and military should buy the lives of sailors with which they're allowed to wear military combat gear.

""The long-term interest of those who want to maintain our military values,"" Lewis said, ""would certainly add up if they made the choice to purchase these massive military-style gear as part of their decorations program.""

""Military-style to try to serve their community with special military medals and experience, however, is very misguided,"" he continued. ""They are taking the place of science and engineering and the actual military training of the human race in an effort to soldier on into the future. Why are we here to respect those rights when we could be ending this, simply in closing you don't know?""

The president has advocated for the reauthorization of the Patriot Act, adding, ""The bureaucracy we need for meaningful oversight of our government is out of date.""

The Pentagon's yearly budget was $4.1 trillion, which puts it at a point in the world where it could run out of money due to sequestration cuts, a recent International Business Times report showed. The median salary for Pentagon officers is $68,483.

"At the Washington Post, political scientists are declaring the George Floyd uprising to be the broadest in US history. The distinction was previously held by the Women?s Marches of January 2017, but the authors analyzed the data and found that the George Floyd protests have occurred in far more places than Women?s Marches did ? including hundreds of minor cities and small towns. In big cities, marches are drawing tens of thousands at a time, and even smaller cities are hosting multiple protests per day.The protests are multiracial, and though they skew millennial and younger, they?re also multigenerational. They?re drawing participants from all across the wealth and income spectrum of the working class, broadly defined. They?re happening everywhere, from high schools to highways. Some are family-friendly pickets, others involve squaring off against police firing tear gas and projectiles. They?re all united under the banner of justice for George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, and the slogan Black Lives Matter as well as the demand to defund the police.And they?re not letting up. ?The United States rarely has protests in this combination of size, intensity and frequency,? wrote the researchers at the Washington Post. ?It usually has big protests or sustained protests, but not both.? What?s happening right now, while it builds on a decade of mounting protest movements, is genuinely unprecedented.Few saw this coming. For example, I wrote an article two months ago in which I speculated that the coronavirus pandemic shutdown would be an intermission in what has otherwise been an age of mass protest ? the eye of the hurricane, so to speak ? and that when the shutdown was over and the coast was clear the protests would come roaring back with ferocity. I did not think mass protests would occur in the middle of the pandemic, and I certainly didn?t expect they would focus on the long-standing issue of police violence against black people.Pinpointing the precise combination of forces and pressures that converged to produce this uprising at this time will occupy historians and journalists for years to come. But one thing does seem clear so far: the brutal police response to the protests merely emboldened them. They are partly responsible for giving the movement the mass character it now has.The police are violent. People protest police violence. The police brutally crack down on the protestors, generating more antipathy for police and therefore more protestors against police violence. It?s a tale as old as time, and you?d think police officials would have learned by now that excessive use of force in these scenarios is bad strategy.But I suspect they weren?t acting from a place of strategy so much as from defensive pride. It was in this emotional state that police not only brutalized protestors over the last week but topped off their aggression with spiteful flourishes, from spitting on fully restrained protestors to pulling down their masks to pepper-spray them directly in the face. As I observed last week, the police by and large do not appear to view themselves as peacekeepers in this conflict. They seem to see themselves as combatants whose goal is not to restore order and protect the public but to defeat their opponents: the protestors.An academic paper from 2017 sheds some light on this phenomenon. In ?Protesting the Police: Anti-Police Brutality Claims as a Predictor of Police Repression of Protest,? Heidi Reynolds-Stenson examined the police response to thousands of US protests that occurred between 1960 and 1995. She found that police ?are about twice as likely to show up to anti-police brutality protests compared with otherwise similar protests making other claims and, once there, they intervene (either make arrests, use force or violence against protesters, or both) at nearly half of these protests, compared to about one in three protests making other claims.?You?d think the police would take pains to avoid appearing to brutalize protestors whose primary grievance is police brutality. But Reynolds-Stetson found that ?despite the possibility that reputational concerns would lead police to deal with such protests with special caution, police actually react to the threat posed by these protests with a more heavy handed response than other protests.? It is precisely the anti-police sentiment that makes them angry, which in turn makes them hostile, which finally leads them to behave in ways that intensify popular anti-police sentiment.That appears to be precisely what happened in the last week and a half. The earlier protests were accompanied by more property destruction and theft, which is not broadly popular, but the police more than made up for it by perpetrating in some cases extreme violence against peaceful protestors. Outrage at the police reaction has driven more and more people into the streets, giving the movements an ever-broader character.Now, in cities across the country, police appear to have backed off, at least from the daytime protests ? not totally, but noticeably. This is probably in part because officers are fatigued and demoralized, and in part because they realize their initial aggression backfired. As a result of this partial retreat, the daytime protests in particular appear safer, which invites more people, and more kinds of people, into streets. Even those who aren?t participating are largely supportive, including 57 percent of white respondents to one survey (only 26 percent opposed) and, amazingly, 45 percent of Republican voters (only 22 percent opposed). These numbers were up significantly from the previous week.Over the weekend, many daytime protests across the country had a festival-like quality to them. At two I attended in Los Angeles, the police were nowhere to be seen, apparently opting to save their tear gas and rubber bullets for those who lingered after dark. But the change in police tactics came too late. They have unwittingly helped create a mass anti-police protest movement, one that?s happening in cities and towns across the country. And unfortunately for them, it?s bigger than any protest movement the country has ever seen.",human
"MINNEAPOLIS ? The calls for sweeping reforms to policing that have reverberated since the death of George Floyd slammed into the messy realities of lawmaking on Friday, offering a glimpse of the uncertainties of turning protest into policy.Nearly a week after nine members of the Minneapolis City Council made a drastic pledge to take apart the Police Department, the council took its first steps on Friday in a slow, complicated process that could eventually lead to shifting funds from the city police. But that process will last for more than a year and require voters to actually approve of removing the Police Department from the city?s core departments.And in the State Capitol, an ambitious package of police reforms proposed by Democrats faced an uncertain future as Republicans who control the State Senate said they would oppose some of the most far-reaching changes, such as restoring voting rights to felons or putting the state?s attorney general, rather than local prosecutors, in charge of prosecuting killings by the police.Republican leaders said they would support five less contentious measures, including banning chokeholds and providing more money for ?de-escalation? training. Democrats said the Republicans? proposals fell short of the fundamental changes that tens of thousands of people have demanded in how the police treat black men and women and other people of color.?We should do the work that the people have demanded that we do,? Melissa Hortman, speaker of the Minnesota House and a Democrat, said in an interview.There is not much time for finding common ground. As a special session got underway on Friday to address policing, the economy and the coronavirus, leading Republicans said they hoped to wrap up all of their work by the end of next week.?We?re not going to stay in special session for months and months,? State Senator Paul Gazelka, the Republican majority leader, said at a briefing on Friday. ?We?re going to do the things we can do now.?It was a sobering reality check for Democrats who have embraced activists? calls for transformative changes that include going as far as cutting the budgets of local police departments or drastically rethinking how the police interact with people in their communities.?This is not what Minnesotans of all persuasions are asking us to do,? said State Senator Jeff Hayden, a Democrat whose district includes the Minneapolis neighborhood where Mr. Floyd died after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for nearly nine minutes.Still, police departments, cities and states across the country have already made a flurry of changes after the upheaval, including re-examining police budgets, banning chokeholds and removing officers from schools.On Friday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York signed a broad package of bills aimed at combating police brutality. Some of the bills had languished for years in the face of opposition from police unions. The bills included a ban on the use of chokeholds as well as the repeal of a decades-old statute that had allowed the police to keep disciplinary records of officers secret.But while Minnesota has become ground zero for protests, it is also showing the enduring obstacles facing the overarching changes many activists are demanding, especially in a 2020 battleground that is the only state in the nation where Democrats and Republicans each control one of the two legislative chambers.While Democrats and liberal activists are leading the calls for change on the streets of American cities, many state governments are controlled by Republicans who back law enforcement and are leery of proposals to defund police departments or make it easier to sue officers. Polling is showing support for many reforms but widespread opposition to defunding the police, a term that can mean different things in different cities.Reform efforts in Washington face similar challenges after Democrats unveiled a sweeping bill this week aimed at addressing racial bias and the overuse of force in policing.In Minneapolis, the City Council?s move to reduce the role of the Police Department was hailed by activists as a transformational change and condemned by conservatives as a lurch toward lawlessness.Wayne Reyes Jr., whose father was shot and killed by Minneapolis police officers in 2006, said he was hopeful that lawmakers would make meaningful changes this time, but said he was angry it had taken more killings for them to do so. Derek Chauvin, the former officer who has been charged with killing Mr. Floyd, was one of the officers who opened fire at Mr. Reyes?s father, Wayne Reyes Sr., a Native American man who the police said aimed a shotgun at them.?It seems like people have been asking for these changes for a long time,? Mr. Reyes, 35, said in an interview, ?and it wasn?t until just the last couple of weeks that people are starting to look and listen a little bit.?On Friday, Minneapolis?s efforts to alter policing in the city appeared mostly to be a slow, governmental grind. To achieve its aims of dismantling the Police Department as it currently exists, the City Council plans to ask voters to approve rewriting a section of the City Charter to eliminate a provision that dictates a minimum number of police officers. That change would give council members much more flexibility to divert funds to mental health and other agencies that could respond to calls traditionally handled by the police.The ballot initiative would also include removing the Minneapolis Police Department from the charter ? although not necessarily abolishing it altogether ? and adding a new department ?focused on cultivating public safety.?The City Council also voted unanimously, at its virtual meeting, on a resolution to commit to a yearlong effort to research other models of public safety and to listen to what residents say they would like to see.Andrea Jenkins, the vice president of the City Council, said the world was looking to Minneapolis to see how it would respond after the killing of Mr. Floyd last month.?People have marched all over the world, all over the city of Minneapolis, and what they?re saying to us is they want change,? Ms. Jenkins said. ?Not ?fix it,? not reform, but change. So we must take these voices seriously.?The resolution passed on Friday creates a ?Future of Community Safety Work Group? that will soon begin listening to residents, interviewing experts and studying other models of public safety to determine how various city services could replace many of the Police Department?s current functions.Alondra Cano, the chairwoman of the public safety committee, said in an interview after the vote that the engagement of city residents would be vital to determining the right solutions for public safety in Minneapolis.?The beauty of this project is that the answers come from the community, that collectively, the future of this city will be decided by the people who live here,? Ms. Cano said.She added that the initiative to get rid of the City Charter?s requirement that the Police Department have .0017 employees per city resident would remove a large hurdle that stands in the way of redirecting funds from the police to violence prevention programs and other city agencies. If the initiative does get on the ballot in November, it would require a majority of voters to pass.",human
"AUSTIN, Texas ? Slamming the Austin City Council for cutting millions of dollars from its police budget, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas proposed legislation on Tuesday that would punish any Texas city that does the same by denying it the power to increase property taxes.?Any city that defunds police departments will have its property tax revenue frozen at the current level,? Governor Abbott told reporters on Tuesday. ?Cities that endanger residents by reducing law enforcement should not then be able to turn around and go back and get more property-tax dollars from those same residents whose lives the city just endangered.?The move, which the governor announced alongside other top Republican leaders at a news conference in Fort Worth, comes as a number of major cities around the country are overhauling policing and shifting resources and responsibilities away from the police to other city agencies, in response to public protests over police brutality and other abuses.The proposal escalates a continuing showdown between the Republican-led state government and the leaders of some of the state?s largest cities, most of which lean Democratic.The Austin City Council recently approved $21.5 million in immediate budget cuts to its police department, and a redistribution of current police functions that, if fully implemented, would shift away an additional $130 million.Mayor Steve Adler of Austin said the city has made a ?transformative move? that would help make the capital city ?even safer.? But it ignited a storm of opposition from the governor and other Republican officials.?When crime is on the rise, the last thing we should do is defund law enforcement, and yet that is exactly what Austin did,? Mr. Abbott said at the news conference, which also included Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick; Dennis Bonnen, the speaker of the Texas House; and Mayor Betsy Price of Fort Worth.Mr. Patrick, who presides over the State Senate, said he would make the property tax freeze bill a top priority when the Legislature convenes in January. And he said that lawmakers would also seek to roll back Austin?s cuts.Mayor Adler said in a telephone interview that the city was not cutting public safety as drastically as state officials say, and was simply transferring some police functions to other departments.?It seems to me that the purpose of the press conference was to make people scared and to make people afraid,? he said. ?And unfortunately, we?re going to see more of that as we get closer and closer to November.?The political conflict in Texas is one of a number unfolding across the country as cities re-examine policing in the wake of protests over the death of George Floyd, who died during an arrest in Minneapolis in May.Protesters have demanded fundamental changes, substantial budget cuts and transfer of responsibilities that could more appropriately be handled by social services departments.More than a dozen cities, including Minneapolis, have considered substantial cuts to their police budgets, but some have since faltered.Calls to defund the police contributed to a shift of roughly $1 billion away from the New York City Police Department. In Los Angeles, the City Council approved the reduction of $150 million from police budget for reinvestment into social programs. But in Seattle, talk of drastic cuts to the police budget prompted Chief Carmen Best, the first Black woman to head the department, to resign in frustration.Many of the proposals have met with opposition from local and state politicians like Mr. Abbott, who say the changes could impair the ability of the police to fight crime and protect property.At the news conference in Fort Worth, one of the most conservative cities in the state, Republican leaders applauded city voters? recent renewal of a half-cent sales tax that provides long-range financing for the police department.?For me, and most mayors, public safety is Job One,? Mayor Price said.Details of the proposed property tax freeze will probably emerge before the next session of the Legislature, but Mr. Abbott said that his intention was that cities ?will never be able to increase property tax revenue again if they defund police.?",human

"Pols face ire of 'Defund the Police' force, from Seattle to New York City

More from UPI: ""These are the same protesters who have thrown things at police over the past year?giving rise to the Occupy Movement, the Tea Party, the student movement, and all sorts. Many of these protesters never showed up. They were never stopped. They lost their lives, their families, and their communities.""

More from The Daily Caller: ""A growing number of protesters have left UW for the University of Washington and decided to stay away. They are upset with a department in which they have only permitted themselves to be bullied in some way as well as a UW police contingent that is supposed to operate out of office spaces. They make no commitment to any of their students or community activists in this matter. They take their own safety seriously, they go to town against their own interests, they engage in nonviolent civil disobedience.""

As an Oregonian report claims, the UW police department has seen a pattern of abuse by students, who are apparently motivated by the anti-police brutality support he's seen for decades. According to an anonymous UW cop I met with over a year ago, members of the UW police department were aware of a ""nonceivent act"" in which they ""made clear that they are not to be bullied by police."" This is not uncommon. According to the Stanford University Police Department. Another example in Florida also came from a local high school who reported that his ""officer was using his power to attack a man in the middle of a sidewalk and taking his phone and cell phone. He also said he was using his cellphone in the face of a person who had said they tried to hang onto him about nine feet away from a car. This was a very violent attack.""

We don't know what exactly this means, but according to our understanding of how the University of Oregon police department is, it is not appropriate for officers to ""enable lethal force"" as it is ""contrary to the common understanding that deadly police force does not . .necessity to be used as a weapon.""

In Oregon, the university has been known to be particularly paranoid about police brutality and its ""community cohesion,"" as the university's president John Swenson and his deputy Chief of Police David Sauschuck are reporting. They have been warning the authorities ""to maintain a peaceful atmosphere between officers and citizens, in order to demonstrate our commitment to the safety and well-being of our community, and that this would be a mistake to have the police department in our community to maintain a peaceful atmosphere.""

We are told that when universities do act in the community, the police officers and the community itself have to act in ways that are appropriate. The same could be said to a high school in Oregon whose campus has a campus-wide, non-violent, non-violent, peaceful community, and one such community as Portland has a campus-wide non-violent, non-violent climate, and one such community as Portland may be an unfortunate source of fear in Portland.<|endoftext|>Sebastian Vettel is likely to win the Italian GP

"The Best Way to ?Reform? the Police Is to Defund the Police""I (2011) In a book of his lectures, we read, as one might expect from one, a book called ""The True Secret of the Police,"" a highly entertaining account of the difficulties of conducting police a certain way. The book, by way of an interview with the father of a police officer, provides a glimpse at the various ways that cops are actually empowered to lie. The result is a book which is filled with great historical detail and which is also one of the best books to cover all of the police tactics like to hide them as well as be a visual representation of themselves.It does not hurt to consider what ""police"" means, the only one by the way is, as it is written in this book. The only thing wrong to come from ""police"" is that they never really went into my apartment building in New York. All the police are called the ""squader"" and these are the the ones who are going to take responsibility for their own lives.<|endoftext|>NEW YORK/DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he was ""extremely concerned"" by reports on a U.S.-Russia collusion after he met senior Russian diplomats last week.

The U.S. president met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during a morning meeting at the White House in the East Room in Washington, a U.S. State Department official said on Friday.

""While I am deeply concerned he is in the process of leaving the U.S., we're going to have to see what he sees in return,"" the ambassador to Russia, Sergei Babakov, tweeted.

Ties between the two countries are also strained and in June Russia accused the Trump administration of funneling Russian funds and arms to Kurdish fighters in Syria who were fighting ISIS in northern Iraq.

Pentagon spokesperson Gennady Gatill denied Trump had any idea that Trump was thinking about his talks with the Kremlin, saying the president had already put his name to it.

""The president has already taken his time,"" said Gatill, whose comments were made at an opening of a summit meeting of foreign ministers of the Middle East two weeks ago.

The U.S. has been under pressure to rein in Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has rejected efforts for a ""Greater Evil"" solution of the region's crisis.

Trump, who has previously denied any collusion with Moscow, recently met with Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, seeking to explain how the two countries got together.

""This administration has gotten much less respect than the Russians,"" Trump said early on in the meeting. ""I think we just started a dialogue. We made a wonderful deal.""

The U.S. administration has not ruled out suspending relations with Russia if all the Kremlin issues with the West become clear.

A Russian Foreign Ministry official said Washington would take questions from the U.S. on Russia's relationship with Russia and would allow those issues to be explored.

Putin was not on the panel that heard the White House and the Russian diplomats, but Trump could be expected to address questions about his meetings with Russian and Iranian officials later in the week.

U.S. officials said Friday morning Washington's discussions with Lavrov and Lavrov had ended in a trilateral meeting.

The U.S. president had previously called the meeting between Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister and Iranian ambassador, ""very cordial.""

Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesman said Trump was disappointed in the White House's decision to cut off relations with a foreign government last week.

""The President of the United States condemns the interference of Russia in last week's U.S. Presidential Elections,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Robert Palladino said.

The State Department said in a statement that Trump had ""been very forthcoming with respect to the nature of the discussion.""

""The President's comments about our discussions with the U.S. President are completely in line with his own understanding and that was the position of the President of the United States,"" the statement said.

""In the aftermath of these developments, we are expecting Russia to work very actively with our foreign minister - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov - to encourage positive outcomes for international peace efforts, and to facilitate a peaceful resolution of these issues in order to avoid any conflicts.""

The U.S. State Department was expected to discuss the incident with Lavrov on Friday before a meeting of the high-level Russian-U.S. officials.<|endoftext|>The new album from The New York Times, NME and the New School Project has been made available on Spotify and Apple Music through Apple Music.<|endoftext|>The ""Big Five"" of The White House and the Republican National Committee (RNC) made it clear on Tuesday that they believe President Obama is a racist.

"Abolish the Police? Those Who Survived the Chaos in Seattle Aren?t So Sure

In the U.S. of 26 separate trials that have taken place and continue to result in the most arrests in American recent political elections, there has been a very clear effort this year by the Obama Administration to have their work disrupted by people who were already in the midst of the war. Although not a war in itself, the U.S. invasion of Iraq was actually about making Washington safe.

It is true that even though the Democrats have carried out their ""war on terror"" campaign in this presidential election, and the FBI is conducting its own ongoing investigation of the allegations, the same tactics used to justify the ""war on terror"" have been used by the Administration to try to justify and counter the ongoing war. The only evidence against those methods, including the use of chemical weapons, were the presence of ""weapons of mass destruction"" during the Iraq war. The Department of Defense (DOJ) and the CIA have repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that as part of this ""war on terror"" they intended to destroy Iraq but had no plans to conduct any direct military action. So here we have Obama taking the side of a very prominent, prominent American man who has been a target of U.S. war by the Democratic Administration and yet is trying to justify what he had to say.

According to The New York Times, Obama also spoke with a select group of foreign leaders, including ""the most powerful"" U.S. military leaders in the world, who were members of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. According to the Times, Obama spoke with Prime Minister Joseph R. Biden Jr. ""with a high degree of confidence about the outcome of this struggle,"" and even praised his foreign minister because he ""can believe in the vision of an American foreign policy that is centered in Washington.""

As President, he has fulfilled several of the requirements of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, including the security of Libya and the responsibility of the United Nations Security Council to deal with terrorism and terrorism.

""The United States will have the authority to take action in the direction of the United Nations Security Council, although most of the U.S. Government has so far had the power to take action only on the condition that it gives the international body rights to take action that is necessary for security, economic or diplomatic ends,"" stated ""It would be foolish and reckless to have unilateral actions at the UN, such as diplomatic or military.""

Obama also spoke with an enthusiastic NATO member and called the meeting ""fair, fair, fair and fair to our allies in the region and the region.""

It is highly unlikely that any of the members of the United Nations will be allowed to commit themselves to the peace and security conditions and military actions necessary for a NATO-led NATO summit in Annapolis in Maryland. Yet the US will be directly responsible for that action and will not take any actions that are not necessary to take it. The United States must work with those nations in Syria to fight against ISIS, and the Obama Administration should be able to take control of the situation without interference from those countries.

Obama has been in full support of his foreign policy and his efforts are in the forefront of a debate about how many countries are willing to cooperate with him and the U.S. that is in some ways very different from this past week. He, the next president of the US has been very careful about how many different countries are willing to agree to do everything for peace, security and stability in the region.

What might the future of our NATO alliance be like in Afghanistan?

This last week was an interesting NATO summit, featuring an international conference and representatives from countries attending to lead NATO members into a single mission: a ""transition strategy"" with a focus on Afghanistan's future. Afghanistan will not be an option for a future NATO mission given the U.S. role in Afghanistan. The war in Afghanistan is about driving the U.S. and its coalition partners down the road from another failed political pursuit that was the plan of the Bush Administration to take over two world capitals by the end of the Obama presidency.

In light of the recent decision by the president of Afghanistan for military training that Afghans still have to relinquish to Taliban fighters, who now comprise the Taliban, and who has become the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) in Syria, the only possibility should there be a new U.S.-Afghan war. These countries, like the Gulf States, support al Qaeda forces. The U.S. will not be able to accept al Qaeda forces or support the Taliban, and the U.S. will have to take responsibility for that. But the Obama White House should start giving some credit to the United States. The president should immediately seek to ensure a strategic partnership with the Pakistanis, Afghanistan, and Iraq as well as to strengthen its foothold in Afghanistan.

There is one small hurdle.

The issue is that Pakistan has been the focus of a protracted war in Afghanistan since",machine
"ATLANTA ? In the wake of the death of a black motorist by a white Atlanta police officer, the city?s mayor announced on Monday a series of changes aimed at dramatically overhauling how the Police Department uses force.De-escalation techniques will now be required before an officer employs deadly force, said Keisha Lance Bottoms, the city?s first-term mayor, and officers will be ?duty bound to intercede? when they see other officers engaging in unreasonable applications of force. The city?s 2,000-plus officers also will be ordered to use only the ?amount of objectively reasonable force? to protect themselves and others so that they can make an arrest or bring an incident under control.?It is clear we do not have another day, another minute, another hour,? Ms. Bottoms, who is black, said of the executive orders, which came on the heels of the resignation over the weekend of the city?s white police chief and the termination of the officer who shot and killed the 27-year-old motorist, Rayshard Brooks.Ms. Bottoms, like many other U.S. mayors, has struggled to seek a balance between law and order and compassion for the demonstrators that have flooded American streets since the death of George Floyd, an African-American man killed last month when a Minneapolis police officer restrained him with a knee to his neck for nearly nine minutes.The death on Friday night of Mr. Brooks, in the parking lot of a Wendy?s restaurant, prompted a weekend of angry demonstrations in Atlanta that included the burning of the restaurant, and amplified a growing chorus of voices calling for a national re-evaluation of when the police should be allowed to use deadly force.The nationwide effort to tighten the rules governing when and how police officers should use deadly force gained momentum after the 2014 police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and has picked up steam since the killing of Mr. Floyd. Significant changes in use-of-force policy have been adopted by state and city governments as some protesters continue to call for police departments to be defunded or abolished.The recent uproar over policing reflects a marked shift away from a decades-long reality in which police officers have been given considerable leeway in making split-second decisions to use lethal force.Before announcing the efforts in Atlanta, Ms. Bottoms had already organized a task force charged with mapping out a potential overhaul of the department?s use-of-force policies. Shean Williams, a lawyer who has brought police brutality suits against the Atlanta Police Department and was named a member of the task force, praised the mayor?s new orders, saying that they were a ?substantial step toward actual change.?Mr. Williams said the current policy left too much ambiguity over what was considered reasonable force and lacked a rigorous system to hold officers accountable for their actions. He said that many in the community had lost trust in the Police Department.?Her executive order is a steppingstone toward rebuilding that trust,? Mr. Williams said. ?She has an opportunity and the city has an opportunity to be the light for this nation on progressive police reform.?Vincent Champion, the southeast regional director for the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, a union that includes the Atlanta force, said that the policies Ms. Bottoms outlined did not appear to be a departure from those currently in place.And he assailed her for describing Mr. Brooks death as a ?murder,? which she did during the news conference, saying that it maligned officers while the shooting remained under investigation.The sustained protests across the country in the weeks since Mr. Floyd?s death have prompted a nationwide reckoning with racism that extends far beyond questions of policing. And in Georgia, Mr. Brooks?s killing was the latest in a series of recent controversies that have reminded residents of the worst injustices of the past.Last week, the state?s primary election was marred by a meltdown of a new computerized voting system that forced many people to wait in line for hours to cast a vote. In South Georgia, the killing in February of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man, by white men who told the authorities they thought he was a burglary suspect, has echoed with the dark history of Southern lynchings.On Monday morning, hours before Ms. Bottoms spoke live on national television, thousands of demonstrators peacefully took to the streets of downtown Atlanta to decry those perceived injustices and call for solutions, including the repeal of the state?s citizen arrest statute and the passage of a statewide hate-crimes bill. Georgia is one of four states without such a law.transcript?On June 12, one of our biggest fears became our reality. Not only did we lose another black, unarmed male, this time it landed on our front doorstep. Not only are we hurt, we are angry. When does this stop? We?re not only pleading for justice, we?re pleading for change.? ?Rayshard Brooks, the name that may start a protest tomorrow or another day in the future. However, the man himself no longer has a future. He can no longer live in the present nor plan for tomorrow. How many more protests will it take ? to ensure that the next victim isn?t your cousin, your brother, your uncle, your nephew, your friend or your companion ? so that we can finally end the suffering of police excessive force??The roster of speakers in the majority-black city included local politicians and boldfaced names with Atlanta roots, including the hip-hop artist Jeezy. Lloyd Pierce, head coach of the Atlanta Hawks, the city?s N.B.A. franchise, spoke with raw emotion of his pride in being black as members of the team stood silently behind him onstage, their faces obscured by masks in an effort to protect against the spread of the coronavirus.Mr. Pierce said he would die a black man. ?But I don?t want to die because I?m a black man,? he added.Late Monday morning, the family of Mr. Brooks gathered for a news conference in which they laid bare their anguish and grief. Mr. Brooks?s niece, Chassidy Evans, said she had watched a video of his killing Saturday morning that had circulated around social media without initially knowing that the man was her uncle.?Not only did we lose another black, unarmed male,? Ms. Evans said. ?This time, it landed on our door step.?According to the police account, two officers responded to a 911 call about a motorist who was asleep in his car and blocking the drive-through lane. Their initial conversations with him were respectful and even intimate, with Mr. Brooks describing how he had been celebrating a daughter?s birthday earlier in the night.After failing field sobriety and breathalyzer tests, one of the officers told Mr. Brooks they had to arrest him, according to video footage of the incident. But at the moment they tried to place him in handcuffs, Mr. Brooks tried to get away. He and the officers wrestled on the pavement, and then Mr. Brooks escaped with one of the officer?s Tasers in his hand.Garrett Rolfe, the now fired police officer, chased close behind, and while Mr. Brooks was running, he lifted the Taser toward Mr. Rolfe and fired it. Mr. Rolfe pulled his handgun from its holster and fired. Mr. Brooks fell as cars idled in the drive-through lane.On Saturday, as tensions in the city mounted, Ms. Bottoms criticized the shooting. She called for the firing of Mr. Rolfe, who is white, and announced that the chief, Erika Shields, would be replaced by an interim chief, Rodney Bryant, who is African-American.The other police officer, Devin Brosnan, has been placed on administrative duty, officials said. Paul Howard, the local district attorney, is investigating the shooting but has not yet said whether charges would be brought in the case.Mr. Bryant, the interim chief, appeared with Ms. Bottoms at the news conference, dressed not in a police uniform, but in a dark suit and bow tie. He spoke briefly, but the moment was dominated by Ms. Bottoms, whose name has been floated as being under consideration as a potential running mate for the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, Joseph R. Biden Jr.Ms. Bottoms spoke with passion of the pain Mr. Brooks?s shooting had caused her, and on occasion fought back tears. Her father, Major Lance, was a minor R&B star who had spent time in prison on drug charges, and Ms. Bottoms has often spoken of her family?s story as she has sought to make criminal justice changes a key policy goal.On Monday, it was no different.?My anger and frustration matches theirs,? she said of the protesters. ?The difference is that I am using the bully pulpit that I have as mayor to effectuate long-lasting change in the city.?",human
"Ex-Hillary Clinton spokesman slammed after endorsing ?defund the police? pushback. ""Just when you thought this is a good idea that we don't have to worry about, we do have to worry about the police killing of the black community,"" she said. ""But we have to think about black lives ? we cannot talk about this, we must remember this.""

In his tweet, Trump had called for protests in Paris on February 1 against ""the police shooting of Laquan McDonald"" ? a shooting which killed five people and injured others ? to return to a more familiar line.

The New York Times, in publishing a long history of allegations that police officers were involved in the shooting of McDonald in Minnesota, cited the report by the department as an example.

The newspaper did not name the slain black victims in her article.

""You never know what you'll be put in,"" she said. ""You don't know what you're going to do.""

It was not clear, though, whether Trump is willing to push a political front that he's already engaged in. His support for Trump appears to be growing, however. An overwhelming majority of Democrats endorsed the presidential candidate, which was a stunning endorsement in a state Trump won in 2016.

Some Democrats have questioned the notion that Trump is trying to push an agenda for police officers ? if they ever have or will.

""This is really a very dangerous proposal for a president,"" said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who is in favor of a bill to restore the shooting of Laquan McDonald, a McDonald who is shot in Minnesota, this year. ""It's an insane idea.""<|endoftext|>

Whether it's a 360 game, a gaming app, or a TV, it should be perfectly playable right now.

Now that we're really past the release date, I honestly do hope that we'll see some of the ""Best Of"" videos already in the system's store: I think that will be the console's best experience this generation, and I do hope that the 360 will be the first to offer that type of quality. But we won't be going to any TV in the system's catalog, and so you can definitely watch the 360 here too.

The Xbox One will launch to a massive high of 8.7 million pixels and 3.4 million pixels, and it will be available to all of the devices, with support for 1080p 60FPS and HDR support, all of which are supported on the system's Xbox One. So just imagine if Nintendo were to allow those apps to live on on all the Xbox One devices on any of the devices to play games that are currently open, all the ways to go to the full screen, and so there should be an incredibly wide range of 360s. Nintendo also announced that they'll be introducing the next Zelda game, which is a new platform in which Mario and Zelda are set as the main characters, although the Wii U version is still not officially announced yet, possibly due to new hardware. These systems should be a huge boost in Nintendo loyalism. I'm going to be asking the questions for our Nintendo fans, and while I'm sure they'll have a lot to say on this, I feel that we should also expect a big, huge shake-up for the console. If you're not familiar, the Switch is also being introduced to this system in a game called Zelda 3D. This is called Zelda, and if Nintendo decides to give it the Nintendo Switch's new functionality it will be a spectacular piece of hardware.

In its most recent incarnation, when the Wii arrived in the form of the Shield 3D app, Nintendo had the chance to unveil some of the most impressive Xbox One online and game experiences that the company could have for its 3D 360 and 360 games. The Shield 3D app showed off new 3D controls and features such as the 360 face animation, plus the game control options to set up the screen, a new voice mode where the console can learn your interest.

While Microsoft is having a great impact on their console's sales, I don't think you're looking for a massive bundle that's available to every person, so I have a feeling that the first update for the Xbox One will be coming in the spring and early summer. However, I think we can expect a big update to the platform in a month or so.

I guess thanks to Sony and Microsoft having to make this a reality!

"Stacey Abrams says 'Defund The Police' movement creates 'a false choice idea' about police reform "" and 'Making America Safe Again' ""

""It's time for us to put our head down and work with local police departments to create a true community policing program that protects all communities while doing just that,"" Abrams said during a press conference Monday in Columbus.

DHS is placing $1.5 million into the Department of Homeland Security's Central Region Youth Programs, which will provide 30,000 youth with behavioral health needs support and outreach programs.

Since taking office last week, DHS has worked with the region's police department in Middlesex County to help improve the way police deal with the community crisis.

The department will train 30,000 youth at 20 police departments from kindergarten through college. Most youth conduct behavioral health programs at two or three different time periods, but they'll also go to community service centers.

""We need to get them involved in these prevention work,"" said Elisabeth Mitchell, a staff-management specialist at the Hudson Memorial Institute.

The criminal justice system is often viewed as unhelpful for teens, however.

NYPD opened more than a dozen programs to get accreditation from the Adult Psychological Association, but only a small fraction of the programs are supported by the state. Most are focused on children, although some are still deemed essential anyway.

At one Cleveland Center building, a $4 million project will clear extra space for 30 youth and improve relations to more children. A few areas in the area will also be open to children and families, including the installation of catwalk programs in structures to protect kids from drowning.

The program will be housed in the Department of Public Safety Building, and in the building will open to staffers of Youth at Work, city officers and interns. The department also is looking to expand the program to other areas across the City while the program expands, including the installation of adult art installations in the East Side.

""We've had some people who appreciate what we're doing all around them, and they'll know it. The community is grateful,"" said Linda Goodman, executive director of the anti-violence program.

The Youth Protection Team, which includes two North Country Youth Programs, worked with the city on the project. The units will focus on various aspects of crime that have triggered recent violence incidents.

The organization already has six Youth In Crisis programs in Milwaukee and Miami.

""I believe that this trend is a mistake given the tremendous attention crime has been getting"" from the city of Chicago, said Phyllis Wheatley, president of the Youth Protection Equipment Service.

The Chicago CPS grant provides funding to the Youth In Crisis Program.

There is no information available on the funding given to Milwaukee and Miami-Dade County police agencies.

When you think of what's going on in France, well, there are thousands of different types of taxis in the last few years, different kinds of taxis in different parts of France; like how the railways are not working anymore. And also how you can find an app called the Air France, to find the routes of you which have been taken and the times how many seats are left for Air France.

So just knowing that this is a French version of the whole problem in this country is very interesting.

Just imagine if, in January and February as the French Minister of the Economy, I talked with Mr. Hollande and the new Socialists of Nationalism and Socialism, there was an article in Nature, which was being written about this country. This is the ""revolutions of the French Economy.""

It's not surprising because there seem to be a huge number of factors affecting the financial sector. But then when you have the financial crisis of 2008, the economy is very different. Now, it seems that the whole world is on the brink of financial collapse, and the French people have become very sickly from the turmoil. The banks are under pressure from the banks, from the collapse of public pensions. In fact, they have to be bailed out by the state, and the French people like a good vampire. But there is absolutely nothing to be afraid of. This has happened too, in France now. They have had such an international financial crisis in this country. Now they are all in the same situation that it is almost impossible to save even.

So there could be a crisis that is spreading everywhere.

You know, this is the same phenomenon in Britain, because there was a really big crisis in the 1930s and [there was] a great panic elsewhere, and the situation is very bad everywhere. That's why I think Mr. Hollande should spend a lot of time thinking over this. You know, this is an election right now in a country like France. The entire French people are now talking about the fact that there is a financial crisis. And I would think that Hollande should have taken a lot of time to consider this. If the banking crisis became very obvious ? it",machine
"?Defund the police? wrests support from politicians coast-to-coast ? and steamrolls holdouts who were looking ""too easy"" by doing a public job that made the point that ""the police"" was a phony name for a fake crime

What does a police ""police"" do when they have to fight crime to get their hands on a gun? On top of all this, when a cop tells a cop he knows if an officer has a gun, how long will they be before police can start beating him up for something wrong?

I also don't just complain about having cops say ""we should fire people to shoot them as well"" because we are afraid they will throw us on the street.

When this happens, it is the police who are at fault, even if they make the big mistake of letting a cop shoot to kill at all.

""You never know what they will do.""

In defense of the police, a cop would argue if a cop is doing the wrong thing, when he thinks a cop actually fired his weapon into the air, that this is ""too bad,"" because he is too afraid of something he might encounter on a bad day.

He won't say ""you get a knife.""

And I guarantee you, they will even throw me on the street, because that is what the police do. But when officers start yelling they go right back.

It is also a double whammy, of course, because the ""police"" are the bastards who keep getting to blame in the name of good cops.

I hope we get a good resolution with the police. This is probably the best possible outcome but this will have to be negotiated for me.

I would argue if you do not understand what happens because I am not a cop, then I will not take the time to educate you in the lesson.

You see, the police were the first to attack by shouting ""We got killed, we got killed!""

The cops are the ones who call the police ""we got killed!"" They are the ones who are killing cops. The cops are the ones who talk to a cop about the ""civil rights"" of cops, like the cops talking to a cop about their ""due process"" procedures.

The cops talk to a police officer about the ""due process procedures"" that the cop has taken as ""reasonable.""

The ""due process procedures"" were the officers that took the ""due process procedures"" that the cops had taken as ""reasonable.""

I think even if you want the best result for the cops, it has to be enforced, because the cops have the authority to do everything they want to do, that has to be done by the cops.

The officers are the ones who are the ones who are not supposed to be doing their job. They are the ones who are doing their job.

I would disagree with the cop saying, ""Hey, shoot me, I get you fired!""

Let me explain how I did my job. I was a licensed officer in the police force on 9 June 2004 and I worked for the FBI for eight years. I was only licensed as a licensed cop from 1996-2011 and I had a special training in firearms safety. I also was a private citizen, and for this I was paid well and was advised in no way of a criminal problem.

I was, the police and they talked freely.

I was given my free training with a special training. I was informed of many of the issues I was dealing with and of my own life.

Here is what I was told:

I have not been fired.

I am an American citizen and has been, since 2nd-2, been, but I do not have to be terminated. I never heard me say the word ""res terminated"" because I was a legal resident of the police, because I was a citizen, I am in the military, and it is an illegal violation of American law.

I do not have to be terminated.

I am an American citizen and has been, since 2nd-2, been, but I do not have to be fired to maintain my employment

I am an American citizen and has been, since 2nd-2, been, but I do not have to be terminated to maintain my job. I am an American citizen and has been, since 2nd-2, was, but I do not have to be fired for maintaining my employment

I have not been terminated. I only have to be fired on a case-by-case basis for not going to court, and the cases are not on the court-case basis. The case-by-case basis of not being fired may be an issue of internal conflict or disagreement within the situation in which it is necessary.

I am a citizen and has been, since 2nd-2, been, but I am a citizen and has been, since 2nd-2, been, but I do not have to be terminated",machine
"MINNEAPOLIS ?ÿNine members of the Minneapolis City Council ?ÿa veto-proof majority ? pledged on Sunday to dismantle the Police Department, promising to create a new system of public safety in a city where law enforcement has long been accused of racism.Saying that the city?s policing system could not be reformed, the council members stood before hundreds of people gathered late in the day on a grassy hill and promised to begin the process of taking apart the Police Department as it now exists.For activists who have been pushing for years for drastic changes to policing, the move represented a turning point that they hope will lead to a transformation of public safety in the city.?It shouldn?t have taken so much death to get us here,? Kandace Montgomery, the director of Black Visions Collective, said from the stage at the rally. ?We?re safer without armed, unaccountable patrols supported by the state hunting black people.?The pledge in Minneapolis, where George Floyd died 13 days ago after being pinned to the ground by a white police officer?s knee, reflected calls across America to rethink what policing looks like. Protesters have taken to the streets with demands to shrink or abolish police departments, and ?defund the police? has become a frequent rallying cry.Officials in other cities, including New York, have begun to talk of diverting some money and responsibilities from police forces to social services agencies, but no other major city has gone as far in reaction to the protests as the Minneapolis officials have promised to do.transcriptFrom The New York Times, I?m Michael Barbaro. This is ?The Daily.?Today, several major U.S. cities are now proposing ways to defund and even dismantle their police departments. John Eligon on the thinking behind those plans and what they might look like in practice.It?s Tuesday, June 9.(CHANTING) I can?t breathe! I can?t breathe!In the early days of the protests after George Floyd was killed ?(CHANTING) No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace!? it was just pure emotions and raw rage.[EXPLETIVE] these racist [EXPLETIVE] police!But pretty soon, once the more fiery protests and fiery unrest died down, then we started seeing the organizers come in and talking about what they want. And one thing we quickly saw were these face masks that people were wearing. They were black, and they had yellow writing on them. And they said, ?Defund police.?Hmm.And from there, you start hearing these calls at protest, at rallies.(CHANTING) Defund the police! Defund the police!You start hearing, ?Defund the police.?You start hearing calls to abolish the police. You start seeing people waving signs. And it became clear that this was an opening that a lot of activists saw to take this moment of a very brutal police killing and turn it into something much larger.Do the right thing!Defund the police!So John, what do these concepts ? defund, dismantle, abolish the police ? what exactly do they mean?To defund, when activists say that, what they mean is taking money away from the police department?s budget and redirect it toward other things ? whether that be social services, agencies, maybe mental health agencies ? that can do functions that police are often called on to do.Mm-hmm.But if you fully defund it, you can get to a space where the police department is abolished. And so essentially, what that means is that there is no more police department as we know it. You don?t call these men and women in blue shirts to come racing to your door with their guns in hand. It means that they have to figure out some other form of providing that public safety, and the police department would not be that form.And where did these concepts come from?Well, at their core, they come from the problems and issues that especially communities of color, especially black communities, have had with policing. They see police coming into their communities to brutalize them, not to protect and serve them. And that has really influenced this desire to keep the police away, to do something else. And we?ve seen, basically, that governments and police forces, they respond with certain reforms. We?ve seen efforts for body cameras. We?ve seen diversifying the police departments. We?ve seen changes to the rules on use of force.Mm-hmm.But what became clear to a lot of today?s activists, and what they say explicitly, is that these reforms are not working. If you look at since Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Missouri six years ago, the police have continued to kill people at high rates, and especially black people at disproportionately high rates. And so for them, the only solution is to tear it down and build something new.So John, what might it actually look like in practice to defund or abolish a police department?So for instance, if someone is homeless and they?re struggling on the streets, a person can call 9-1-1, and instead of an armed police officer being sent out, perhaps there can be an outreach worker from a homeless services agency. Or if you have someone having a mental health episode, then again, you can call 9-1-1, and instead of a police officer, maybe a health care worker, a mental health worker will come out. And the idea behind it is to really cut down the interactions between armed police officers and civilians. And by doing that, the hope is that it will reduce their conflict and the potential for people getting hurt or killed by police officers.Right. I mean, that makes a certain sense, especially for a community where there?s not a lot of violent crime. But every community is different, right? And some towns, some cities ? I think about New York City, for example ? have a significantly higher rate of violent crime that would seem to require having armed police. So how do activists think about that?For a lot of the activists that I spoke to, the issue was about centering public safety on communities. And one activist that I spoke to, Arianna Nason, she said essentially it?s going to be up to each community to decide what public safety looks like for itself.It?s going to be up to every community to decide what they need. We can?t decide that.So maybe that?s armed patrols. Maybe that?s mental health workers. Maybe that?s some sort of mobile units with social workers sitting in it, and people are trained in using force and different things. One of the big ideas is this idea of community policing, community watch. And it?s interesting. I had said isn?t an issue, though, with community policing or community patrols, neighborhood watch, that if I walk into that community, as a black man with dreadlocks, if I walk into one of these communities, we see what happens with neighborhood watch. We see Trayvon Martin. We see Ahmaud Arbery.Should that be a concern, then? I guess with this community-type based model that certain people who look a certain way might go into the neighborhood, and that community might decide to take it into their own hands and then take it overboard, I guess.And she took off her sunglasses. She looked at me, and she said ?No, I get that. And I?ll be really real with you. For me, personally, I don?t have all the answers for that. I don?t. And I wish I did. A lot of it is ?Honestly, I don?t really know the answer to that right now.Huh.She was not sure exactly what the answer was. And see, this is all to say, it?s still very tricky and very much a work in progress. But what she did say is that the current system also is not working for me either. So it?s a matter of what are they going to do differently? And they believe that something drastically different needs to be done.Mm-hmm. As best you can tell, would any of the familiar elements of an existing police department ? I?m thinking, for the sake of argument, homicide detectives, special victims units that investigate sexual assault or rape ? do those remain? Do they take a different form? Do they adopt a different name? Has that been fleshed out?I would say, no, it?s not been fleshed out. Because again, we go back to the fact that this is not going to be some federal commission, or even state commission or a city commission for anywhere that?s going to come up with, like, these are the rules for public safety now. And these are all things that need to be worked out. And I think what people say with things like homicide investigations, with sex crimes investigations and things like that, they say a couple of things. One, the police are not doing a good job at those anyways. So you have lots of cities where the clearance rate on homicides and other investigations is miserable. You had, even here in Minneapolis, there was a big scandal with all the rape kits that they had untested. So they had a lot of issues with crimes that were not being investigated properly. And then, the second thing that people say is that those jobs can be taken up by specialized, trained people. You can build new institutions to do those things that aren?t necessary policing. I did talk to one council member who said, maybe there?s still police, but for very, very limited role, and many of their responsibilities are farmed out. You know, anything short of some sort of active violence, you don?t need police for. So in some people?s eyes, that would still be a police force. But one thing that the people who are most ardent about abolishing the police or defunding the police, even, they make it clear that they don?t just want a system in which it?s police in another name, police with another uniform on.And these demands to defund the police, they?ve actually been brewing in Minneapolis for several years now. Ever since a police killing back in 2015, there?s been several local activist groups working on it. And those activist groups came together this past weekend in what was probably the biggest and most clearest demand for defunding the police.We?ll be right back.(CHANTING) Abolish the M.P.D.!So there were hundreds of activists who went and gathered in front of the mayor Jacob Frey?s house.Abolish the M.P.D.! And they had a megaphone. They were chanting. They were screaming. And sure enough, the mayor came out to talk to the protesters. He kind of made his way through the crowd, walked up to the front, and you had one of the lead organizers for a group called the Black Visions Collective. Kandace Montgomery, she was standing up on a riser there, talking down in a megaphone to the mayor.Jacob Frey, we have a yes-or-no question for you. Yes or no, will you commit to defunding Minneapolis Police Department?[INAUDIBLE]And you could tell, like, there is this hesitation because he knows this is not going to go well, right? You have all these very vocal, very ardent activists around you who want you to defund the police.Will you defund the Minneapolis Police Department?[CROWD MURMURING]All right, be quiet y?all. Be quiet, because it?s important that we actually hear this. It?s important that we hear this, because if y?all don?t know, he?s up for re-election next year.[CROWD CHEERING]And then ?I do not support the full abolition of the police department.All right!You?re wasting our time! Get the [EXPLETIVE] out of here!And he gives his answer ? he does not support full abolition of the police.(CHANTING) Go home, Jacob, go home! Go home, Jacob, go home!And he turns around, and he just kind of walked off into the sea of people.(CHANTING) Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame!So after this event, there was already an event planned for the following day by some of these same activists organizations, in which they were going to bring council members who were supportive of their cause onto a stage in a park in the Southern part of the city. And they were going to try to get them to make a commitment to defunding the police.So a lot like what they had done to the mayor?Exactly.Hi, Minneapolis. You look so beautiful today. I?m Lisa Bender. I?m the president of the Minneapolis City Council.And so we had this gathering where there were hundreds of residents.Our efforts at incremental reform have failed. Period.And you had council members.Our commitment is to do what?s necessary to keep every single member of our community safe, and to tell the truth that the Minneapolis Police are not doing that. [CROWD CHEERS]And you had nine of them who went up on the stage.We are here today to begin the process of ending the Minneapolis Police Department. [CROWD CHEERS]And then all nine of them each read a part pledging to defend the police.All of us on this stage support this statement, and we stand with the people of Minneapolis in fighting for a safer community. [CROWD CHEERS]The last council member, he basically said, and we are all committing to this pledge. And at that moment, it was like this emotional eruption.[INAUDIBLE], get up, y?all. We are transforming our city right now. Get up! getYou had white people, black people, Asian people, all putting their fists in the air, shouting, defund the police, defund police.(CHANTING) Defund M.P.D.! Defund M.P.D.! Defund M.P.D.!So just to be clear, this is not a vote, and not necessarily even a pledge to vote, but this is a public commitment to defund the police ? to do the very thing that the mayor, when asked, declined to agree to 24 hours before.Yes, exactly. This is a pledge that they are going to defund the police. It is not a vote. It is not anything set in stone or written. But these are putting them all on record in front of many community members, saying that we are going to do this. And I even asked the activists about that. I said, we?ve heard politicians say things before and not keep those pledges. But this is something that they saw they?ve been working on with them together in tandem. So I think there?s a level of trust there that this pledge has really meant something. And you could see it in the reaction of the people who were there. They were really describing it as their Civil Rights Movement, their Voting Rights Act moment.Wow. And John, can the members of the City Council who were in that park, making this pledge, do they have the actual authority to take away funding from the police department?Yes, they absolutely have voting authority to do that. The council actually controls the police department?s budget. And what?s more significant about this moment is that because there were nine of them, those nine seats represents a veto-proof majority. So even if the mayor, Jacob Frey, does not want this to happen, if that coalition sticks together, they can do this on their own. And I think what we?re seeing is this sentiment is growing in traction in certain places. Like we already have in New York and Los Angeles, the mayors in both of those cities have already said that they are going to be redirecting funds that were intended for the police toward other parts of the city, toward other agencies in the city.I?m curious what the appetite for this kind of change to policing is, beyond the cities where there are largely Democratic city councils and mayors, and where this is now under discussion.That?s a very key question, right? We?re already seeing conservatives coming out against this and talking about this is as very radical leftist step to be taking. We see Donald Trump already tweeting about it. So certainly, this is something that, for conservative communities, something like this would be a tougher sell. And so again, policing is a very local thing. So what you experience and what the police force does or does not look like in Minneapolis is going to be very different than what it does or does not look like in Edina, which is just outside of Minneapolis, or any other suburb. So it?s going to be, in some ways, a patchwork of public safety, I think, if these things start happening around the country.And I guess an open question is whether or not this has entered the mainstream, even of the Democratic Party. Just a few hours before you and I began to talk, Joe Biden came out and said he does not support defunding the police.Yeah, this is certainly not something that is part of the mainstream or moderate Democratic platform. That said, you do get some people who might be in these more moderate spaces, you do get their attention and you do get their ear, is this sense that policing is not working ? which is just the basis of what these defund or abolish the police efforts are about, is that the system is not working. And so you will get even the more moderate folks to say that, to buy into that. And that may not result in them supporting a defund or abolishment, but will it support more stringent reforms, more significant reforms to police? So we?ll see what happens.I wonder how the activists that you?re talking to see the challenge of explaining what these concepts are going to mean. Because in this moment, I think many Americans are really hearing these calls ? defund, dismantle, abolish ? for the first time. And they may be very wary of them, and they may see them as quite radical.What the activists will tell you is that while it might sound radical for many Americans, this actually is not all that radical for a large section of this country.What was your name, sir?YaazirahHow do you spell that?Y-A-H- ?If you go to black and brown communities ? like I went up to the North Side of Minneapolis ? and you talk to people about their experiences with the police there, it is not the experience of expecting an officer to come and help you. It?s exactly the opposite. And I was speaking with a couple there, Amanda and Yaazirah Brazelton.It?s about time for a change.A change, yeah.Yeah. About time for a change.And they were telling me that from a young age, essentially, they already had horrific experiences with the police.[INAUDIBLE] I have police put guns in my face, you know, at seven years old, coming to my house with my mother and my father arguing, just regular argument that happens with a husband and wife.Yaazirah, he was seven years old when the police came to his house when his parents were having an argument.And they put guns in my face and put us all on the ground.And then they stuck a gun in his face.They traumatized me in childhood, so I was really against white police officers since.And his wife Amanda, she was 14 when she was in a car with white people, and she?s black.We were driving in the car. All my white friends got out. And as soon as I got out, they pulled guns, yelled at ?And when they were pulled over, the cops let the white people out, but then they pulled guns on her.I?m 14 years old, in the backseat of the car, not doing nothing wrong. And that was my first real incident with the police in that interaction.And so the way they see the police department is not a force where you call and then an Officer Friendly shows up.Man, I got a houseful of kids that are scared of the police because of what they?ve seen.It?s one where Amanda recalled her children have already had run-ins with the police that when someone was breaking into their house once, she didn?t call the police, but she called family and friends.And I called him. I called my brother. I called my uncle. I called my dad, my mom, before called the police.Why didn?t you call the police?Because they kill black people. They?ll call me, I?ll get killed in my own home.So it?s already a lived experience, a lived reality for people in many black communities, that the police are essentially a force that only exists, in their eyes, to harass them, to brutalize them and not to protect them. And what the activists hope is that people who are scared that abolishing police will suddenly lead to a breakdown in their communities and just rampant violence, they?re saying, no, this will create outcomes that will make the community safer and better, not just for affluent white communities, but for all communities across the country. And so what activists are asking is that people who see this as a radical idea, who can?t envision a world without police, they?re asking them to just walk in these people?s shoes, understand what they?re going through.John, thank you very much.Thank you.The nine members of the city council that came from every corner of our city to stand together to make this commitment, we don?t have all the answers.In an interview on Monday, the president of the Minneapolis City Council, one of the nine members who has pledged to defund the city?s police department, acknowledged that implementing the plan would likely take years.And if you look back at the last 150 years of our police department, it is becoming increasingly clear that that model of policing isn?t working. I hope it won?t take 150 years to get to that looking forward, that next solution. But we have a lot of wisdom in our community. We have invested in [INAUDIBLE] ?We?ll be right back.Here?s what else you need to know today.Good morning, everyone. The Justice in Policing Act establishes a bold, transformative vision of policing in America.On Monday, Congressional Democrats introduced the most sweeping federal plan to reform the police in modern memory.Never again should the world be subjected to witnessing what we saw on the streets in Minneapolis ? the slow murder of an individual by a uniformed police officer.The legislation would reduce the legal protections that now shield police officers accused of misconduct from being prosecuted, and would impose new restrictions to prevent police officers from using deadly force. The measure is expected to quickly pass in the House, where there?s a Democratic majority, but faces an uncertain future in the Republican-controlled Senate. Meanwhile, state-level reforms continue. On Monday, New York?s legislature banned the use of chokeholds by police and repealed a statute that effectively hid the disciplinary records of police officers.And ?Almost 7 million cases of Covid-19 have now been reported to W.H.O., and almost 400,000 deaths. Although the situation in Europe is improving, globally, it?s worsening.The World Health Organization said that the number of new daily infections from the coronavirus hit a record high ? more than 136,000 on Sunday ? and warned that mass protests in places like the U.S. could further spread the virus.We encourage all those protesting around the world to do so safely. Clean your hands, cover your cough and wear a mask if you attend a protest.Finally, the National Bureau of Economic Research said that because of the pandemic, the United States economy officially entered a recession in February, ending the longest economic expansion on record. It began in 2009 and lasted 128 months.That?s it for ?The Daily.? I?m Michael Barbaro. My colleague Caitlin Dickerson will host the show tomorrow.Council members said in interviews on Sunday that they did not yet have specific plans to announce for what a new public safety system for the city would look like. They promised to develop plans by working with the community, and said they would draw on past studies, consent decrees and reforms to policing across the nation and the world.Protesters who gathered at the windswept rally, with a view of Powderhorn Lake, said what mattered most was that elected officials had finally committed to a sweeping overhaul of policing, even though they had not offered specifics of how a dismantling would work.?There needs to be change,? said Paola Lehman, a 23-year-old actor and educator in Minneapolis.As the council members each read a line of the pledge to the crowd, Wintana Melekin, 32, clasped her hands above her head wrap, her mouth open in stunned silence beneath a sagging mask with the inscription ?Defund Police.??I knew it was happening, but I didn?t believe it,? she said.When the final portion was read, a roar went up among the hundreds in the crowd. Many people raised their fists in the air and chanted, ?Defund M.P.D.!?Though the City Council controls the police budget, the department answers to Mayor Jacob Frey, who has a veto over the Council?s actions. Council members said they had enough votes to override a veto by Mr. Frey, who was booed out of a rally by hundreds of people on Saturday after he said he did not believe in abolishing the Police Department. Mr. Frey quietly exited through an angry crowd as many shouted ?Go home, Jacob Frey!? and ?Shame! Shame!? Councilwoman Alondra Cano, who leads the Council?s public safety committee, said that scene made her think about the need to create space for discussions ?ÿa truth and reconciliation commission of sorts ?ÿto develop solutions to the city?s policing issues.?Protesting is good and needed, press conferences are good and needed,? she said. ?That third space is needed where we are committed to each other, and not the camera.?Mr. Frey said on Sunday that while he opposed dismantling the Police Department, he would ?work relentlessly? with the city?s police chief and the community ?toward deep, structural reform and addressing systemic racism in police culture.? He added that he was ?ready to dig in and enact more community-led public safety strategies.?The City Council voted on Friday to accept a civil rights investigation of the police by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights and to amend the Police Department?s use-of-force policy to ban chokeholds, among other measures.Protesters? cries to defund or abolish the police are often not meant literally. Rather, they are demands to rethink a law enforcement system from the ground up and to grapple with deeply ingrained issues, including employing officers who do not live in the city they police ? as is done in Minneapolis ? and sending armed officers to respond to situations that turn out not to be crimes, as when a mentally ill person is in distress.Some proposals have focused on ending heavy-handed police tactics like no-knock search warrants and military-style raids on the homes of suspects, restricting the flow of military gear to police departments and banning the use of military equipment on protesters.A common thread has been the tendency of police departments to consume ever larger shares of city budgets.?We?re really saying we want to grow our community, and we want to invest in the things we actually need,? said Ms. Montgomery, who led the protest on Saturday and grilled Mr. Frey on his views, leading to the chants that prompted him to leave the scene. Council members and activists pointed to examples of different styles of policing in places like Austin, Texas, where the operators who answer 911 calls inquire whether a caller needs police, fire or mental health services before dispatching a response, and in Eugene, Ore., where a medic and a crisis worker with mental health training are dispatched to emergency calls.Many have called for relying more on self-policing by the community, in the way attendees often do at events like music festivals, with the police stepping in only when a true emergency arises. Some cited as an example how, in the days after the killing of Mr. Floyd, teams made up of dozens of members of the American Indian Movement patrolled streets and directed traffic in the Little Earth housing community in Minneapolis.Patrisse Cullors, co-founder of Black Lives Matter and chair of Reform L.A. Jails, said the move by the Minneapolis City Council members had shifted the movement to rethink policing from the fringe to the mainstream.?This is massive,? Ms. Cullors said. ?This is the first time we are seeing, in our country?s history, a conversation about defunding, and some people having a conversation about abolishing the police and prison state. This must be what it felt like when people were talking about abolishing slavery.?Many advocates note that city budgets are already strained by the coronavirus pandemic, which shut down business and tourism, sharply reducing tax revenue, and that police budgets may be especially vulnerable.The city of Minneapolis is looking to cut $200 million from its $1.3 billion overall budget, according to Lisa Bender, the president of the City Council. She said she hoped to reallocate some money from policing, which received $189 million in the 2020 budget, to other areas of need in the city.Councilman Jeremiah Ellison, who represents North Minneapolis, said he would not frame what the Council was doing as defunding the police, but rather as ?funding a different safety strategy.?He said: ?Is the goal to execute some kind of vendetta against M.P.D? No.? Lt. Bob Kroll, the president of the Minneapolis Police Union, did not respond to requests for comment.Andy Skoogman, executive director of the Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association, said he supported reforming rather than defunding the police. While he welcomed additional investment in social services for mental health, domestic violence and homelessness, he said, the traditional police force ?is an essential service and must still be funded.??When someone is in immediate danger, fearing for his or her life, would these victims still have a place to call and a person who is willing and able to help?? he asked. ?If so, then we?re open to more discussions.?Activists have been calling for change in the Minneapolis Police Department for a long time. Outrage over police killings prompted many of the current City Council members to run for office.?We warned them years ago that this will become the next Ferguson,? Nekima Levy-Armstrong, president of the Racial Justice Network, said of city officials. ?They didn?t listen.?Ms. Levy-Armstrong said she was worried about completely abolishing the Police Department, fearing that city leaders would make decisions without sufficient input from minority communities.?If they want to disband the police,? she said, ?they need to come up with ways and methods to keep our people safe.? After the accusations of police brutality through the years, the failed past attempts at reform and then the horrific footage of Mr. Floyd?s killing ? as well as the police response to protests that has included rubber bullets and tear gas ? major changes to policing in Minneapolis are now inevitable, said Kenza Hadj-Moussa, a spokeswoman for TakeAction Minnesota, an advocacy group.?No one feels safe calling the police, period,? she said. ?They?re not doing their basic function of public safety.?Farah Stockman and Eric Killelea contributed reporting.",human

There is no greater duty to our patriotic people than to recognize the freedom of our citizens to choose what they like.<|endoftext|>It's a matter worth watching that last week, when the president of the National Security Council has made it clear that Afghanistan is still part of the world.

On this Wednesday, as his successor, Gen. David Petraeus, prepares to leave office, the president will visit Kabul. On the way down to Afghanistan, Afghanistan's young leader said goodbye: ""This was a mistake; I have to continue to do everything I can to bring about a healthy democracy.""

That the U.S. is the only NATO member country he met without Karzai in Kabul was a point of great consternation ? but the message seemed to pass.

It was a point in which the president told his national security team that if Russia was going to intervene in Iraq, he hoped that the Afghans would not support the Obama administration, and that they would not be helped for two crucial reasons.

First, Afghanistan is not a major country, and it may remain divided. (It is still divided about whether Washington's war with Iran ? and the war in Afghanistan ? is a war on Russia.) Second, it remains the center of instability as the country is growing. Afghanistan has not voted for president, even though the American military has shown many times greater strength by deploying thousands of soldiers into its territory than a year earlier.

A country like Afghanistan, though, has not shown complete unity.

Trump's remarks could be interpreted as a threat to U.S. defense, but Afghanistan is not a big country. It has never held more than two presidential elections in five years. It is a country with vast potential for expansion to 10 other NATO member countries. But in Afghanistan, this may not be an option even many American policy-makers have acknowledged.

The next presidential election in Afghanistan will be seen in the context of a two-year anniversary of the nation's surprise defeat after taking office. During the first half of the decade, at least a dozen Afghan security forces have been defeated by the Obama administration ? more than 2,000 in Afghanistan and about a dozen more who were in danger of being murdered by the enemy. President Hamid Karzai was ousted as president in 2010 and signed into law an agreement with the American military to restore 10,000 U.S. troops to the country. He has promised that he will return many thousands of soldiers and that, if he wins, he will force the American troops out of Afghanistan.

The next president should know that he is a longshot.

But Afghanistan is not an all-American state ? and anyone with close relatives could be dead by now. The country needs its own security guard. And Kabul won't be an all-American state.",machine

"LOUISVILLE, Ky. ? After months of protests that turned Breonna Taylor?s name into a national slogan against police violence, city officials agreed to pay her family $12 million and institute changes aimed at preventing future deaths by officers.The agreement, announced Tuesday, settled a wrongful-death lawsuit brought by the young woman?s family. As her mother, her lawyers and leading activists walked into the council chamber alongside the mayor, there was a momentary show of unity, after months of nightly, sometimes violent demonstrations that have left Kentucky?s largest city boarded up. It comes six months after the death of Ms. Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency room technician, in a botched drug raid, but before the state?s attorney general has said whether the officers involved in the shooting would be criminally charged ? a key demand of protesters.?My administration is not waiting to move ahead with needed reforms to prevent a tragedy like this from ever happening again,? Mayor Greg Fischer said. ?When you know what the right thing to do is you do it. Why wait??The agreement, which did not require the city to acknowledge wrongdoing, was sizable, with her family receiving more than double the amount paid to the relatives of Eric Garner, the New York man who died in a police chokehold in 2014. While a few similar cases resulted in larger payments, from $13 million to a whopping $38 million, some of them came only after years in court battles. By contrast, the Louisville agreement was reached in just months.Most of all, it was unusual because of the range of changes ? a dozen in all ? that the embattled city agreed to adopt in an effort to quell the protests.?Based on at least 20 years of tracking these types of cases, I?ve never seen something like this,? said Christopher 2x, a community organizer Ms. Taylor?s family turned to after her death. ?The bottom line is the monetary amount, combined with the reforms, is unprecedented.?The policing changes would require more oversight by top commanders, and make mandatory safeguards that were common practice in the department but were not followed the night of the March 13 raid. They would also put in place an early warning system to flag officers who have been accused of excessive force.Ms. Taylor died after her boyfriend said he mistook police officers for an intruder, as they rammed in the door of her apartment after midnight to execute a search warrant. He fired his handgun, striking an officer, setting off a response in which a torrent of bullets sliced through Ms. Taylor?s apartment and two adjoining ones, leaving her bleeding in her hallway.Since the young Black woman?s death, the top demand of protesters who gather nightly in a downtown square has been that criminal charges be brought against the three white officers who shot into Ms. Taylor?s home. But because the officers were fired upon first, legal experts say their actions may be protected under Kentucky?s statute allowing the police to use lethal force in self-defense. For that reason, they say it is unlikely that a criminal inquiry being conducted by the state?s attorney general will result in charges against at least two of the officers, who were standing directly in front of Ms. Taylor?s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, when he opened fire first. A third officer, though, has been fired for shooting recklessly that night.The results of the attorney general?s investigation are expected to be released soon. If no charges are brought, or if the charges are minor, the settlement announced this week may be the closest Ms. Taylor?s family comes to justice.?This is a good first step,? said Sam Aguiar, one of the family?s lawyers. ?The city obviously doesn?t have the power to bring charges, which still rests in the hands of the attorney general. But what the city can do is change its police practices, and it can acknowledge through a settlement that a lot of things went wrong that night.?Among the changes are a requirement that commanding officers review and give written approval for all search warrants, a policy that was instituted recently in Lexington, the second largest town in Kentucky, and that has led to a drastic drop in the riskiest raids, said Peter B. Kraska, a professor at Eastern Kentucky University who is an expert on police reform.The department has also agreed to overhaul how simultaneous search warrants are conducted, most likely a result of the manner in which the five warrants were obtained for Ms. Taylor?s residence and four others used as ?trap houses? by her ex-boyfriend, Jamarcus Glover, a convicted drug dealer who had repeatedly made trips to her apartment in the months before the raid. An early warning system will be adopted to flag officers with disciplinary problems, a measure that seems aimed at Detective Brett Hankison, the officer who was fired. Multiple complaints of excessive use of force as well as sexual misconduct had been filed against Detective Hankison, according to portions of his personnel file obtained by The Times, most of them dismissed or deemed not credible.And to promote better relations between the department and the community, officers will be encouraged to perform two hours of paid community service each pay period and will receive housing credits to encourage them to live in the neighborhoods they police, according to a summary provided by Mr. Aguiar.Many of the changes appear aimed at addressing the specific lapses that led to Ms. Taylor?s death: It will now be mandatory for ambulances to be idling nearby when the police conduct a search. Although it was common practice to do so, an ambulance was initially sent to Ms. Taylor?s residence before the raid, only to be canceled and sent elsewhere in the hour before police officers beat down her door. ?It?s really unique,? Mr. Kraska said of the policing changes required in the agreement. ?The family didn?t feel that justice would be served just by a monetary settlement. I have not seen this happen before.?The city had already enacted some substantive changes.Months ago, the city passed ?Breonna?s Law,? which barred the use of ?no knock? search warrants. That was the type of warrant issued for the search of Ms. Taylor?s apartment, which allows the police to punch into homes without warning. On paper, the numerous changes promised by the city appear ambitious. But one of the enduring problems of police reform is that ? to date ? departments around the country have not been able to create a mechanism for enforcing changes.?It absolutely will make no difference if there is not a lot of follow-up and accountability,? Mr. Kraska said.Both Ms. Taylor?s mother and the activists who have played a leading role in the city?s ongoing demonstrations warned that the settlement was merely a first step. As the sound of the drums banged by protesters on the street below wafted into the city auditorium, lawyers and advocates for her family took the microphone to call for an indictment of the officers involved in her shooting.?The restitution portion is one part,? said Tamika Mallory, a Black Lives Matter activist who was arrested here after leading a sit-in on the lawn of the Kentucky attorney general?s home. ?But arresting the officers is what will make this city do right by its citizens ? and not just by Breonna Taylor but by all the Breonna Taylors.?The gathering ended with activists and Ms. Taylor?s family chanting: ?Arrest the cops! Arrest the cops!?Kitty Bennett contributed research.",human
"Law enforcement experts on defunding, dismantling police: 'When you call 911 who is goingÿto come out?' "" said Fredrick M. Gunter, senior vice president of the North Carolina Association of Chiefs of Police, who co-authored a report with Rep. Ted Lieu on the issue.

""The key to their actions is to disincentivize police agencies from actually funding or empowering minority communities or enforcing laws that they've recently enacted,"" said Gunter, who also joined as law professor at George Mason University, describing the projects.

Although most police departments make about $6 million a year to fund local policing, the Violence Policy Center noted the expected $4 billion budget gap between local and federal funding could have a significant impact on how officers perform their jobs.

""Police groups and other community groups must ensure that our officers and communities are the primary means through which our safety is guaranteed,"" said Caruso Schweitzer, a spokesman for the Virginia Metropolitan Police Commission.

The Violence Policy Center estimates police departments use about 3,000 deaths each year in the U.S., including 20,000 in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metro area, and 3,000 more in Kansas City. In 2009 alone, Dallas had approximately 1,200 fatal police shootings.

Related Coverage Chiefs turn issue about police abuse into controversy in Dallas

Although guns are more readily available and some of the same types of violence are more common than others, police reported adding over 10,000 law enforcement officers to the force this year in just a year.

""It may be critical, after all, that we fight another day every time we go into court,"" said Dwight F. Richards, a former state state sheriff's spokesman who has been criticized by gun owners for his un-regulation of firearms. ""All too often, where this population has not accounted for the law enforcement needs, it's almost always in the hands of military, police and military personnel.""

Two years ago, state lawmakers approved a $15 million law that would restore-proof law enforcement on the city block after being shuttered due to injury. The state has said local police will maintain their violence-toughness training, and local unions have denounced police shootings, citing threats from outside groups, such as FBI informants.

""The violence they're losing is the result of having a culture that doesn't engage with the issues on which they fought and not addressing systemic violence,"" said Carol Griggs, a history professor at the University of South Carolina at Chapel Hill who has studied the decision and has been coordinating conversations with black, Latino and other groups about their policing initiatives. ""But this changes it for the worse.""

Russell Smith, the NRA's executive vice president of advocacy and policy, said the new study based on criminal justice data is particularly troubling because other groups ? like the National Rifle Association and the American Civil Liberties Union ? found police-involved deaths are increasing all across the country ? largely because state authorities have cut enforcement resources and officers have struggled to prevent them.

""It is astonishing that the league of the states and other police departments looking at this is not prepared to provide out-of-state training, solutions and equipment to address these kinds of problems,"" Smith said.",machine
"Obama Voices Support for George Floyd Protesters and Calls for Police Reform

May 12, 2016

The Weinstein Company not only acquires Human Rights First's British journalist, Andrew Neil?who is not only the recipient of such support for its decision, but is one of the first people who has ever been interviewed by George Floyd?but for his support for Weinstein's production company and his past sexual harassment claims. It's a significant context and many would argue these scenes from George's vaunted American Music Hall of Fame tour were rather disturbing in the absence of any and all previous evidence of Weinstein's current avoidance of legal liability, which I will argue could only lead to a finding of breach of contract.

In October 2015, The Weinstein Company contacted The Independent:

""If anyone came forward with information on George's sordid misconduct and allegations of sexual harassment (19/9/2016 ? 19/16/2016), please feel free to call on the Weinstein Company and send support through our phone or social media channels."" ""But a month ago, Oscar Grant?an American national, producer, executive producer and director, and one of the original partners in the movie company?started an affair with Weinstein, the young producer, producer and studio head for studios across the globe. He couldn't commit further misconduct on screen and accepted a pay raise at the end of the year. He was found to have assaulted another person and has yet to come forward. The behaviour was not ""true,"" according to The New York Times.

In December 2016, a YouTube video by Oscar Grant has emerged in which he describes the harassment as false and accuses his co-producer, Ed (Charlotte Bevan) of abusing him and demanding he do a-hole in front of him (both her true allegations have since been removed):

""Oh, and I want you to know, it was close, like I said. You don't want to come here; you don't want to come to this country because, even if you have the same wages as me, if your position at the company is that of entertainment middleman [Grimes]. He's been a very cold guy. At times he's abusive and abusive to me, and at times we've done things, I'm pretty sure he's not been impartial with it. So it was weird for me to get very sick after that. How dare you come into this country again. I don't care who's responsible. This will never happen again. And I think maybe I was disrespectful because I didn't understand what he was saying. After watching his termination this morning I'm still having nightmares that he threw everything he had at us and made those remarks to hurt us. If he's the product of this culture and he's trying to force people to stop it, he should be fired. I don't care."" ""So, what I want you to understand, it wasn't just around these key ways he treated us. This stuff's still going on, people are still out there coming in who are an extended family. It has stopped at all. It's still happening. And it's creating the so-called progress and freedom for young people in general and immigrants in particular.""

That this ""progress and freedom"" was created by Christopher Nolan is at best laughable, and at worst extreme. Even more appalling is the fact that No. 6's condition (personal and emotional, er, I'm using the term here) calls for any (rational) recognition of this to be changed for all the good it is. It is perfectly normal for anyone from film to business to motion pictures to film to programming to tell you that one day this person will probably have to spend the rest of his life at a living hell, but the more you tell no one about it the more you can convince yourself that his entire character history has nothing to do with him. The whole thing is only about white money and organized crime when no one really knows for sure where the money comes from, and because so much of how all the normal policing works for these reasons alone don't make much sense. (Their phony crime and real estate backgrounds may help make this all easier, but it will make far worse the fact that Oscar Grant is white and there is at least a case of overt racism going on. Has anyone found out that it's not really white people who are behind it?).

"MINNEAPOLIS ? Political leaders in Minnesota promised sweeping changes after George Floyd?s killing turned their state into a focal point for nationwide fury and grief over police killings and racism.But those efforts collapsed early on Saturday as leaders in the Minnesota Legislature ? the only one in the country where Democrats control one chamber and Republicans the other ? failed to compromise on a package of law-enforcement measures before a special session ended.Ultimately, legislators could not reach a deal that reconciled the Democrats? calls for far-reaching changes to police oversight with Republican leaders who supported a shorter list of ?common-sense police reforms? that included banning chokeholds in most situations and requiring officers to stop their colleagues from using unreasonable force.Democrats said the plan passed by the Republican-led Senate consisted of tepid half-steps that were already in place in most law-enforcement agencies and did not rise to the moment?s calls for dramatic action. Republicans balked at the proposals passed by the Democrat-controlled House to restore voting rights to tens of thousands of felons and put the state?s attorney general, Keith Ellison, a Democrat, in charge of prosecuting police killings.Democrats had argued they should stay in session as long as they needed to reach a compromise. Republicans set a deadline of Friday night before returning to their districts, saying they would be willing to return for a one-day session if they were near an agreement.As the clock ticked toward midnight ? and then far past it ? leaders of both parties blamed each other in competing news conferences. Paul Gazelka, the Republican leader of the Senate, described the state of negotiations as essentially hopeless.?If they?re not interested in this,? Mr. Gazelka said, referring to the Democrats? rejection of his latest proposal, ?I don?t think personally that they?ll ever be interested in something that we can agree to.?Moments later, Jeff Hayden, a Democratic state senator whose district includes the corner where Mr. Floyd was killed, said the Republican plan was unacceptable. ?If they decide to leave here without getting anything done, it?s on their hands,? he said.Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, said on Saturday afternoon that the Legislature?s failure to pass a bill was an ?embarrassment? for the state. He blamed Republicans for creating what he said was an arbitrary deadline and said he was shocked that lawmakers had adjourned without an agreement.?I?m really, really worried the message this sends to all those tens of thousands of protesters who were on the streets, all those families and all those people across Minnesota and across the country that expected this one was going to be different,? Mr. Walz said.Some lawmakers said they hoped the governor would call them back again next week or later in the summer to take up the issues, but activists worried that the window to change the laws was closing as the 2020 election approaches.The breakdown finally came just after 6 a.m. on Saturday, when the Senate?s Republican majority voted to adjourn and the Democrat-led House followed. That came after hours of huddled strategy sessions and standoffish meetings in the Capitol as small groups of protesters gathered outside.While many hearings and negotiations have unfolded virtually because of the coronavirus, State Representative Carlos Mariani, a Democrat, said he sat down with Republicans on Friday afternoon to discuss a compromise.Mr. Mariani said he told them that his fellow Democrats would not vote for any package that did not address structural changes to policing. The Republicans across the table said they had not yet had time to read every piece of the policing bill that the Democrat-controlled House passed early on Friday morning, he said.?Take an hour, take a week, take a month? to read it, Mr. Mariani said. ?We?re waiting, and the pressure?s building.?Republican leaders later said they had agreed to alter arbitration proceedings when officers are accused of misconduct,ÿbut Democrats said it was not enough.All week, state legislators held emotional hearings on proposals to increase oversight of how the police use force and are disciplined; change the process for firing officers; and explore alternatives to policing, such as sending social workers to respond when people in mental distress need help.Families of black men and women killed in confrontations with the police argued that the huge protests and unrest that rippled across Minnesota reflected the cumulative anger of communities that were fed up with police brutality and systemic racism. They cited the killing of Mr. Floyd and the recent deaths of Breonna Taylor, who was killed by the police in her apartment in Louisville, Ky., and Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was chased down by three white residents of a Georgia neighborhood and fatally shot.?Our families are hurting, our communities are hurting,? Valerie Castile, the mother of Philando Castile, the victim of a 2016 police shooting in suburban St. Paul, said in an emotional day of testimony. ?What you saw during these protests are emotions that have been building up over decades.?The Legislature?s failure to pass a bill was a disheartening turn for activists who have pushed for far-reaching changes to policing, including cutting police budgets or dismantling police departments altogether to reduce the presence of armed officers in minority neighborhoods.?Every time someone gets killed, there are promises, investigations, and nothing comes of it,? said Dave Bicking of Communities United Against Police Brutality, a Minnesota-based group that made a series of recommendations to the Legislature. ?If this doesn?t bring something and make us get heard, I shudder to think what it might take.?Governor Walz, who had called on lawmakers to stay at the Statehouse in St. Paul as long as it took to pass a police overhaul package, said on Saturday that he was struggling to think of what to say at a planned meeting with Ms. Castile later in the day.?She felt that God had given Philando to make a difference in the world, and she said, ?No one listened, so that?s why you got George,? and she said, ?Don?t blow it,?? Mr. Walz said.The debate in the Legislature was unusually combative, and tensions worsened this week as members of the People of Color and Indigenous Caucus said some white lawmakers had not consulted with them or valued their input or that of the districts they represent. At one point, the Republican chair of the Senate?s public safety committee, Warren Limmer, who is white, said he did not know that the People of Color and Indigenous Caucus existed in the Senate.State Representative Mohamud Noor, a Democrat, said the comments and actions from lawmakers this past week showed that some appeared to be learning, for the first time, about racial injustice in Minnesota.?That speaks volumes ? that we don?t see people, people from different walks of lives, within the state,? Mr. Noor said on Thursday. ?The racial injustice. The discrimination. The lack of understanding from our perspective, our lived experiences. It?s shameful.?Protest leaders said it was bitterly ironic that the Legislature?s failures came on Juneteenth. Nekima Levy Armstrong, a lawyer and former president of the Minneapolis N.A.A.C.P. who has led many of the recent demonstrations, said she was disappointed but unsurprised by the impasse.?Too many members of our Legislature are not taking this seriously,? she said as she hurried off to help distribute groceries and diapers in a largely black Minnesota neighborhood whose only grocery store had been closed since the unrest after Mr. Floyd?s death on May 25. ?It sends a signal that black lives don?t matter. We feel like we?re under siege in our own state.?At midnight, Democrats in the House shared a counteroffer, dropping several significant demands, including their proposals that the attorney general investigate police killings and that people convicted of felonies be allowed to vote. As they shared the plan with reporters, the lights in the Capitol building switched off. The lawmakers stayed, and the lights flickered back on, but as the sun rose in the morning and a deal still could not be reached, they went home.Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs reported from Minneapolis, and Jack Healy from Denver.",human
"As protesters continue to meet a massive police presence on the streets of New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio and the city council are under pressure to defund the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and reduce its power. Momentum is building for cuts ? the question is how substantial those cuts will be.The uprising in response to the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis is pressing cities and institutions across the country to defund police departments and reinvest in social programs in working-class communities and communities of color. The demand is rooted in the belief that years of new training, body cameras, and attempts to discipline ?bad apples? has failed to address what activists say is the root problem: that the criminal justice system is historically rooted in class and racial control and empowers officers to abuse and kill. No amount of retraining, these activists argue, can change this fundamental function of the police.ÿWhat?s needed is a defunding of police and a shifting of those public resources toward an entirely new approach to public safety.On Wednesday, Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti announced the city would cut $100?150 million of the city?s police department budget. This followed the Minneapolis school board?s vote on Tuesday to end its contract with the police department and the University of Minnesota?s recent commitment to scale back its ties with the police.In New York City, advocates have been calling since April for the city to rethink its priorities in the wake of the pandemic and make cuts to the NYPD, the nation?s largest police force. The uprising is giving new momentum and shape to those demands.Since Mayor Bill de Blasio took office in 2014, the NYPD?s budget has increased by more than $1 billion to nearly $6 billion in 2019, though the proceeds it receives from contracts remain shrouded in secrecy. This $6 billion amounts to more than the budgets for the Departments of Health ($1.9 billion), Homeless Services ($2.1 billion), Youth and Community Development ($907 million), and Small Business Services ($293 million) combined.Even as the city prepares for a new round of austerity due to the pandemic?s economic costs, the mayor?s proposed budget for fiscal year 2021 leaves the NYPD nearly untouched while proposing vast cuts to a range of other social programs. The NYPD would face a Program to Eliminate the Gap (PEG) cut of $16.3 million, as compared to the $470.1 million PEG for the Department of Education, the $177.3 million PEG for the Department of Youth and Community Development, and the $60 million PEG for the Department of Homeless Services. According to the council, the NYPD?s budget faces a cut of less than 1 percent, while the Department of Youth and Community Service faces a 32 percent cut.On April 30, Communities United for Police Reform and about 110 other organizations, including unions, the Working Families Party, churches, and many other community groups called for the city to redirect NYPD funds to other crucial social services. Council member Brad Lander proposed a hiring freeze, and public safety chair Donovan Richards identified $55 million in cuts through cuts to the cadet class and by reducing overtime for summer events, with other council members backing his call. The NYPD defended its untouchable budget in a virtual hearing in May, arguing that a reduction in the police force could result in a crime spike. Council speaker Corey Johnson of Manhattan cosigned a letter on May 30 calling for 5?7 percent cuts across agencies that had not yet made significant reductions, and singling out the NYPD as one of the agencies that needed slashing.But mass numbers of protesters taking to the streets in cities and towns across the country have boosted the case for defunding. Communities United for Police Reform announced on Wednesday that they will fight for a $1 billion cut to the police department?s budget in fiscal year 2021. Public advocate Jumaane Williams and council members Carlina Rivera, Antonio Reynoso, Ben Kallos, Carlos Menchaca, and Brad Lander each joined the Wednesday press conference to express their support for significant cuts.Later that day, 236 current and former staffers who are disappointed in the de Blasio administration released a letter that voiced support for the $1 billion cut. The Policing and Social Justice Project, led by criminologist Alex Vitale, has proposed $1 billion in cuts over four years. On Thursday, comptroller Scott Stringer proposed $1.1 billion cuts over that four-year timeline.?We?re in a place right now to determine what our next futures look like,? said Anthonine Pierre, deputy director of the Brooklyn Movement Center, in a Zoom press conference hosted by Communities United for Police Reform on Wednesday. Asked by a reporter whether organizers worry the issue of police reform will fade to the background once protests end, she said, ?The protests are going to last as long as they need to last .?.?. The only way the issue of police reform fades to the background is if we defund the police, is if we decrease the ability of the NYPD to do things that need to be reformed.?Advocates have proposed different ideas to reduce the budget. A common theme is canceling this year?s police academy class for new recruits and implementing a hiring freeze, resulting in a decrease in head count by natural attrition. (The NYPD has a roughly 3 percent attrition rate per year.) Other ideas include cutting overtime, reducing spending on non-personnel contracts and technology-related expenses, cutting the agency?s public relations budget, and reducing the NYPD?s expansions into social services like social distance outreach and homeless outreach.Communities United for Police Reform also wants cuts related to abusive policing, such as savings from firing officers who are on modified duty as a result of their abuse of New Yorkers. They also object to the fact that the city?s payouts for police brutality settlements do not come out of the NYPD?s budget; one study suggests this may reduce the incentive for the police commissioner to control those costs. While the city council does not have the power to require the NYPD to fire officers on modified duty, the council will soon vote on a bill proposed by council member Richards that would require the NYPD to create a set of transparent guidelines for disciplining officers.Momentum to defund is growing, especially within the city council?s twenty-one-member progressive caucus, but no one knows exactly how negotiations will play out in the council. According to the New York Post, Republican minority leader Steven Matteo, a Staten Island council member, ?opposes ideological cuts but still agreed the NYPD would not be spared? in this year?s budget cuts. Kallos, a Manhattan council member and cochair of the progressive caucus, said in an email on Wednesday that a $1 billion cut should be made as soon as possible, but that the plan to achieve it over four years appears most realistic.Menchaca, a Brooklyn council member and member of the caucus, says he?ll follow the lead of advocates, who are currently calling for a $1 billion cut in the next fiscal year. Council members Lander and Richards, caucus members of Brooklyn and Queens respectively, did not cite specific numbers, but expressed support for several of the advocates? additional ideas, including reducing the NYPD?s involvement in social services such as homelessness, mental health, and youth services that could be performed by other agencies and community organizations.?That is a much more fundamental reimagining of the infrastructure of public safety than is easy to achieve through budget cuts,? Lander says. ?So to me, the cuts that we?re making here are out of recognition that we have a fiscal crisis, and out of recognition of the demands of the movement for black lives to do something significant in this moment. But they?re more likely a down payment on that more fundamental rethinking.?The demand to ?defund? is currently building a bridge between leftists with abolitionist visions and moderate liberals fed up with cuts to social services. Yet as the council dives more deeply into the NYPD budget, it will have to wrestle with a set of complex questions: To what extent does defunding the NYPD mean ensuring the agency must submit, like all other agencies, to this year?s austerity cuts? Or does it mean a deeper shift of what is required to build healthy communities? Does the NYPD need to be subject to a few new accountability measures, or does it need to be vastly reduced?At a press conference on Tuesday, Mayor de Blasio emphasized his belief that public safety takes investments in youth programming, programs that harness community leadership to deter violence without criminalizing residents, and other social investments. He also expressed support for additional police reforms. He did not waver, however, from his position that a large police force is crucial to maintaining the public peace.?For folks who say ?defund the police,? I would say that is not the way forward. At some point in our history, we may be in a very different situation,? he said. ?But, right now .?.?. having a police force that is able to keep everyone safe and able to engage at the community level, having a police force strong enough to do the work of public safety, also the work of building community with people and healing ? I think that?s necessary for now,? he said.As Jacobin reported Tuesday, the New York City Council has played a major role in enabling the expansion of NYPD since de Blasio took office, and even pushed the administration to boost the police head count in its 2015 budget.?In hindsight, I think it was a mistake,? Lander says, reflecting on the council?s push. ?We imagined there would be accountability where there has not been accountability, and that has just grown to be a very real problem.?.?.?. Perhaps it was naive to believe those things.? Activism on the ground has also compelled him to reimagine what public safety means. ?There are so many elements of public safety that we approach through policing that I?d like to see us take a different approach to ? that is an understanding that I?ve come to.?Council member Richards says he doesn?t regret voting for the increased head count, which helped expand the Neighborhood Coordination Officers (NCO) program that he says has led to significant improvements in community-police relations and greater police diversity in his Queens district, the Far Rockaways. Yet he says the policies of the NYPD have been too slow to change and that, in light of the police reaction to recent protests, the progress made by the NCO program has disappeared.?This moment in time and history gives us a lot of momentum to make everlasting changes within the department. And without a doubt, the uprisings around the country, and George Floyd?s sacrifice should not be in vain,? Richards says.Advocates are also pushing for a variety of other legislative steps to improve the accountability of the police force, including the Safer New York Act, a package of five bills in the state legislature. These include a repeal of the state?s infamous Section 50-a, a statute that protects police misconduct and discipline information from public review. It also includes legislation that would require reports on demographic and geographic data on low-level enforcement as well as reports on police killings and deaths in police custody, strengthen the attorney general office?s power over police killings, end marijuana prohibition and direct proceeds to communities impacted by the war on drugs, and reduce arrests for noncriminal offenses. Another bill under consideration would ban racial and ethnic profiling by police. The legislature has announced it will convene next week to vote on a series of criminal justice reform measures. On June 9, the council has plans to vote on a bill that would criminalize the use of police choke hold, along with resolutions to support bills banning and criminalization of the choke hold on a state and federal level. Several other legislative reforms could be in the cards, too.The national uprising has clearly given new power to campaigns to make the NYPD more accountable and its budget less untouchable. The hard part for the council will be figuring out how such discussions should translate into legislative and budgetary action.",human
"In New York, There?s Money for Cops, But Not for Schools

By Maarten E. Blodgett

There is talk of a criminal investigation into the incident that unfolded at a school in America's biggest city. And it's not the only one. The New York Police Department on Monday launched an investigation into possible constitutional violations that would violate Article II of the Constitution.

On Tuesday, there was a series of attempts on the part of Chicago City Attorney Daniel A. Zaffa to quickly convene a grand jury. Mayor Rahm Emanuel publicly announced on Tuesday afternoon that the probe was still ongoing, but the city attorney said he could not have carried out an investigation in the city's government agencies. He said there was still a possibility the police would have made mistakes on their part.

The A's and Rahm Emanuel have both sought to deter and protect school administrators from both a criminal and civil lawsuit filed by over 160,000 former teachers and staff members against both the city and the school district in 2004.

Jim John Epstein, U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and American Civil Liberties Union President Sharonda Miller welcomed the arrests, and said they are intended to avoid ""what appears to be yet another type of prosecutorial bullying.""

In separate news events Monday morning, an A's official said an arrest was ""not imminent.""

The 43-year-old Marcellis, N.Y., native was the first black student, a former elementary school teacher, to be charged with a murder after an altercation with her then 15-year-old son, whom she said was in a crowded classroom. He was not injured in the incidents.

""There's nothing we can do,"" said Michael Griffin, general counsel of Ramsey County Public Schools. ""I see this as a case of child abuse.""

According to details provided by witnesses to the incident, when Marcellis, who has a history of drunken, belligerent behavior, got out of her second-floor balcony in front of the school, the Principal mistook her for a school-teacher.

She approached the Principal when she was confronted by Ed Fort to the ground and threw rocks at him.

After fighting for years, the father attempted to make more threatening demands in language she had never heard before. His message to Fort escalated when he identified her as being in a fight with school police. As a result, three Chicago teachers are still in jail awaiting trial, Griffin added.

School district officials said their parents expressed disbelief when Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced the calls against school policies Tuesday afternoon. The mother also accused her brother of losing custody of her daughter.

As he announced his plans to take office in January, Jim Lewis, the city's general counsel, said the suspension would be lifted but a grand jury would follow up with a decision soon on whether it should bring charges against school officials.

""We can not have another fire as a matter of law,"" he said.

The teens raised children in a small town in northern New York that had seen an all-white population before leaving for college. They watched television shows and magazines while their families lived in the surrounding suburbs.

They walked on sidewalks and into school halls, used art and culture as tool of survival to become socialized and in charge of their lives.

While 13-year-old Kalleta, 18, was ""internationally recognized"" for her ""works as a young person,"" a number of other teens were evaluated as subjects for media play. At age 16, Kalleta was known for being too nervous to watch movies.

Kalleta said she doesn't think she's ever had a problem with school discipline or might ever have.

Local police tried to cover up their pursuit of the nine-year-old and the issue was raised at public meetings. Though officers had several officers on the scene, and officials could not say whether they used excessive force, the finding raises questions about their duty under New York's Article II law.

One of the teachers involved in the earlier incident, Curtis Hines, told The Record Monday that he wants schools to do better in school.

""I think there's going to be changes,"" he said.

The officer involved in the recent incident is acquitted in October.",machine

"On May 25, 2020, the world learned of the brutal killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police thanks to cell phone footage filmed by Darnella Frazier of Floyd?s last moments. Police-worn body camera footage of the whole incident, later filed in court, with the transcript made public on July 8, contains every bit of the horror of Frazier?s video. The eighty-two-page transcript shows that Floyd told the police at least twenty-seven times that he couldn?t breathe, to which Derek Chauvin responded: ?Then stop talking, stop yelling. It takes a heck of a lot of oxygen to talk.?The footage was filed by Thomas Lane, one of the officers charged with aiding and abetting murder who aims to have these charges dismissed. It remains to be seen whether this evidence will strengthen his case. But it?s clear that its existence is a big positive for Axon, the company whose camera captured it and whose name is plastered at the foot of each transcript page.During the peak of June?s Black Lives Matter protests, Axon?s share price had risen to its highest ever level of $101, and today, it still stands 10 percent higher than its price the day before Floyd?s death.Axon?s offerings currently include body and dashboard cameras, streaming drones, cloud solutions to store the petabytes of footage this hardware creates, as well as AI tools to analyze this evidence and even carry out automated live crowd monitoring. The company is just one of the larger players in the law enforcement software market, estimated to be worth around $10 billion, which also includes tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft.But none are as evangelical about the promise of digital policing than Axon?s founder and CEO Rick Smith. Smith has promised to the media on numerous occasions that his company would help ?make the bullet obsolete . . . it will change the world when we do it.? He even wrote a book on this topic last year called The End of Killing: How Our Newest Technologies Can Solve Humanity?s Oldest Problem. Axon?s website makes similarly lofty claims, estimating that, to date, 225,000 lives have been saved by their products.Smith has been somewhat more reluctant to acknowledge that the sole technology the company was set up to sell in 1993 can be every bit as deadly as the gun. Trading as Taser International until the company rebranded in 2017, Axon has provided hundreds of thousands of police officers across the globe with a tool estimated to have killed at least five hundred people in the United States and Canada over a ten-year period.Despite this, much of the current energy directed at severing links between police and tech companies has largely bypassed Axon and focused primarily on ensuring that giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft no longer sell products or enter into contracts with police forces. These companies? workers emphasize the hypocrisy inherent in issuing statements saying they support Black Lives Matter while still providing tools for racist surveillance.But it?s perhaps unsurprising that companies like Amazon adopt the same moral principles they hold in every market they attempt to colonize ? until public relations concerns make it no longer tenable for them to do so, at least temporarily, with their announced one-year moratorium on selling facial recognition technology to the police.The case of Axon, however, shows how some tech companies can become much more deeply embedded in police forces, remaining immune to criticism and profiting from cases of police brutality ? all the while maintaining an outwardly progressive social mission that keeps the promise of moderate police reform alive while skirting calls like ?defund the police.?By the early 2000s, Axon was facing bankruptcy and its business was not growing significantly. That changed when it pivoted heavily into providing body cameras in 2008. As with its current rise in profitability, a police shooting almost a decade ago enabled Axon to promote its new product. In November 2009, police officer Brandon Davis shot and killed Eric Berry inside his own home. Footage from the incident, though blurry and unclear, was enough to ensure charges weren?t pressed and allow the local prosecutor to conclude that Davis?s use of force was justified.Axon publicity materials readily began featuring this case. Some emphasized the speed of his exoneration: ?He was back on the job just 72 hours after the shooting!? Others used pictures and quotes from Davis himself about his enthusiasm for the company?s cameras. In lieu of any clear research on the impacts of body-worn cameras at this point, they were sold as a way to make policing safer for police and provide evidence if needed after the fact.Michael White, coauthor of Cops, Cameras, and Crisis, was approached by the Department of Justice several years later to produce the first systematic review of the evidence around body-worn cameras. ?It was an easy report to write because there were only five studies that had been done at that time. The report was published in April of 2014, and I don?t think anyone read it until August 9, 2014, when Michael Brown was killed,? says White.By December 2014, President Barack Obama was planning to set aside $263 million to fund body-worn cameras and police training, a large amount of which was funneled into Axon, already the camera of choice for police. The continued police killings and cases of police brutality should be evidence enough of their failure to produce reform, but a 2019 meta-analysis also found that body cameras can only ever be as effective as the departments they?re used in allow them to be.?One study looked at the Phoenix Police Department, and the activation rate was about 30 percent, which means that 70 percent of the time, when there was supposed to be a video, there wasn?t. I?ve also seen some studies that have looked at individual officers in the department, with activation rates as low as zero or 1 percent,? says White of research produced since his 2014 report.Despite this, millions of dollars are still being paid out by police forces to companies like Axon, who are aiming to secure steady incomes and shield themselves from calls to defund police departments by operating as a ?software as a service? (SaaS) company, locking forces into five-year contracts for their Officer Safety Plan, providing hardware and cloud storage facilities for $109?$199 per officer per month. The plan promises to help forces ?do more with less,? a familiar offering from tech companies to public services facing potential budget cuts.This often involves outsourcing digital storage, providing algorithmic data analysis, and, disturbingly, leaning on the public to join in on digital surveillance. Citizens can now seamlessly upload footage to Axon?s evidence cloud server, along with racially profiling their neighbors on Nextdoor or providing footage to police officers via their Amazon Ring doorbells.Calls to defund the police should ensure public funds no longer go toward unaccountable tech companies nor expanding digital surveillance, and we should be wary of the risk of these surveillance tools being picked up instead by members of the public. When the city of Camden, New Jersey, disbanded its police force, in its place came hundreds of cameras, ShotSpotter microphones, and a mobile observation tower mostly operated by civilian contractors.The Open Tech Institute, based in Washington, DC, has worked to introduce legislation and bans on many of these surveillance tools for years. It is currently part of the ?Community Oversight of Surveillance? campaign, which is pushing for the DC city council to take up transparency and oversight legislation on surveillance technology. Surveillance planes flying over the BLM protests in DC during June highlight how interlinked ending police brutality, oversurveillance, and abuse of technology are as demands.?Surveillance is deeply intertwined with policing,? says Lauren Sarkesian, senior policy counsel at Open Tech Institute. ?Oversurveillance leads to disproportionate arrests, causing more black and brown people to enter the criminal justice system, as they are more extensively surveilled. So these issues of police surveillance technologies including facial recognition, body cameras, drone surveillance, CCTV cameras, IMSI catchers, and more should be considered and overhauled.?Inevitably, communities will be safer when their residents are not targets for racial profiling, and when their streets are not data points for predictive policing tools. Violence at the hands of the criminal justice system can be reduced when there are fewer police on the streets, but also fewer drones and surveillance cameras above them. In the last five years, Minneapolis police ran training on everything from implicit bias to mindfulness, and their complete failure highlights the empty promise of even the mildest liberal reforms. We can?t lose sight of the tech companies invested in keeping that empty promise alive.",human
"Dan Bongino reacts to the idea of defunding the police as protesters still occupy a 'cop free' zone in SeattleEXCLUSIVE: A Republican group isÿreleasing an ad attacking Democrats over recent calls to defund and abolish police departments in response to the death of George Floyd, playing up the uncertainty about who would respond to emergency calls if police departments are abolished entirely.Local officials have suggested such a dismantling of the police force in Minneapolis, though other prominent Democrats including Joe Biden have pushed back on such calls.The State Government Leadership Foundation (SGLF), a policy group that works with the Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC) to elect Republicans to local offices, will push the ad via television buys and targeted digital buys in Atlanta, Dallas, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, Charlotta, N.C., and Tampa, Fla. Titled ""Danger,"" itÿdepicts a scared woman calling 911 during a home invasion, only to be told by the operator that ""a human resource officer is currently unavailable"" and that the government could send help between 8:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. the next day to help with the emergency.""Defunding the police has become the centerpiece of the Left?s radical movement ? and it?s struck America?s mothers and fathers with the fear of having to wonder who they?re expected to call when their family?s safety is in jeopardy,"" SGLF Executive Director Austin Chambers said. ""From Minnesota to Georgia and all across this country, state conservatives will continue to stand strongly in support of their communities, law enforcement, and meaningful police reform.""TOP MINNEAPOLIS POL DUCKS QUESTION ON HOW 'DISMANTLE' POLICE PUSH WOULD AFFECT CRIME VICTIMS, CITES 'PRIVILEGE'Chambers added: ""The Left?s aspirations for a lawless society is too great a threat to the safety of Americans. We?re going to do everything we can to stop these radical proposals from becoming a reality.""Not all Democrats have endorsed calls to abolish or even defund police departments. Biden and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., are two of the most notable national Democrats to resist the movement. And House Democratic leadership warned its members last week to avoid taking a hard stance on the issue.But calls to defund and dismantle police departments have gained popularity with local officials across the country, going from a fringe idea to the talk of much of the political left in a matter of days as anger over Floyd's death in the custody of the Minneapolis Police Department -- and alleged excessive use of force by departments around the country in handling the resulting protests and riots -- has boiled over.The SGLF ad is set in Minneapolis, which is the site of the most radical and rapidly advancing movement among local government officials to dismember their local law enforcement institution.MinneapolisÿCity Council President Lisa Bender last Monday appeared on CNN's ""New Day"" to explain her city's plan for a ""police-free"" society. She explained that ""we can shift the response away from our armed police officers into a more appropriate response for mental health calls, for some domestic violence calls, for health-related issues.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPBut when host Alisyn Camerota asked her what would happen during an armed invasion -- like the one depicted in the SGLF ad -- she dodged the question.""Do you understand that the word, dismantle, or police-free also makes some people nervous, for instance?""

"How Police Unions Became Such Powerful Opponents to Reform Efforts

By Richard B. Mattingly and Carlos Clitome

ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. (Reuters) - A group of groups opposing reform efforts in Orange County and an economic development group are asking the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate several union-supported efforts by counties to expand workforce opportunities in the biggest college sports league in the world.

The Department of Justice announced on Wednesday that a groundbreaking study from the Center for Economic Policy Research has helped them gauge the impact of employer-driven wages increases on the workforce.

""We are sure there are often instances where a union has stood on the front lines of the struggle in areas that matter to workers, including in the local area,"" says Norman Mandel, a spokesman for a union-affiliated contract manufacturer.

According to the program, salaries for most of Orange County's 55 colleges and universities decreased in the first nine months of 2011 compared with the same period a year earlier. Employers in the Orange County metropolitan area saw the higher cost-of-living decreases due to a four-year increase in state employee benefits.

Orange County Chancellor Carol Welch, a Democrat, and congressional Republican representative Steve Cohen agreed that companies shouldn't be paying higher wages but agreed that programs should focus on economic growth rather than job security.

""It's the better ones who are getting the benefits and not the other way around,"" said Sen. Ted Schwartz, D-Lafayette, a member of the Orange County GOP.

The Center for Economic Policy Research found that 88 percent of employers surveyed in the 2010 study said they were ""victims"" of increased pay raises or reduced employment due to a 1 percent increase in state employee benefits.

Those policies affect less than half of all state employees, the data show.

Citing data from the 2009 federal Labor Department analysis of hired workers, the Center for Economic Policy Research ""found that the higher union salaries, increases in student-athletic tuition and days worked compared with post-secondary education, and payroll taxes and payroll taxes are not a reason to consider a program like Orange County Community Colleges,"" the panel wrote in its report.

Christina Fisher, president of the Orange County chapter of the American Federation for Community Colleges, agreed that schools must offer more options to families of qualified students. ""Higher wages are very important to college students, and if parents are right about that, then what does not need to be done?"" she said in an interview.

David Vekler, chairman of the bargaining unit of Access Southern California, where some eight colleges compete in the latest bachelor's college rankings, said unions should take legal action to get local communities to reduce workers' pay or share them with government agencies.

He said he's not sure local lawmakers have enough practical and financial support to pressure institutions into a deal but insisted that schools should end their collective bargaining deals that limit collective bargaining rights.

""There's no power you can choose from and, frankly, if you don't find the kind of relationships people need,"" Vekler said.

Orange County law requires companies that receive thousands of thousands of dollars in tax breaks to employ workers who can earn between $30,000 to $40,000 per year with short-term and long-term contracts.

Obligatory legislation passed in 2011 to make it illegal for public school districts to pay state workers higher wages instead increased taxes on small business. But unions say they have suffered losses in their efforts to defend private workers and raise revenue.

Saul Buerkle, of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which represents over 1,600 state employees, said local unions such as the California Building and Construction Association and the Association of Community Colleges should focus on recruiting officers to national leadership positions. ""It's important that we do what we can to encourage state and local hiring,"" he said.",machine
"AOC supports Defund the Police demands in wake of George Floyd's death.

The U.S. State Department did not substantiate any allegations that Defund was misusing taxpayer funds to kill two young children

St. Vincent a

Last year, the U.S.A. produced a piece by Chris Williams, a former US diplomat who was referring to his friend and former Canadian Deputy Minister for foreign Relations and Foreign Relations ? ""I don't give a f?king fuck!!!!,"" he writes.

""This country has surrendered its sovereignty, more so than any nation on earth. It's becoming a desert.""

The statement added that this was evidence of ""one of the worst human rights violations in modern times"": ongoing drug war, ""and war crimes,"" and even ""mass incarcerations.""

After the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Defund the Law in the Netherlands on November 14, Dutch police received a report from the country's prosecutor's office, the Netherlands' prosecutor's office, detailing an investigation of Defund ""suspect"" who had committed atrocities, including a firefight with five children, to drug-running operation in a drug detention center in 2014.

A police report from September 2016 stated that ""a large number of suspects were tortured by the police, often in separate, beds inside the facility,"" including officers of the police unit in Nylandt-Neuilly.

On July 26, 2015, the court declared that ""a number of suspects were executed under Defund"" (Ricca) in a drug-running drug raid in Nylandt-Neuilly, near the city of Nederland. The Riveters' head jurist called this ""the worst human rights crime in modern times.""

However, the Dutch prosecutor's office stated that it could not conclude that the Riveters committed torture. The prosecutor's office said it wanted to investigate the ""unspecified"" suspects as well as ""contrary to the evidence the Riveters provided.""

According to the Riveters' report, Riedel's wife had told Riedel that a soldier he had ""armed in the field"" was ""not a person of God."" The two women are accused of having worked for Defund. The Riveters believe this was their own company. A police report from June 2015 stated ""Riedel made repeated threats to [defund] the officers and their colleagues.""

However, this report, as summarized by Riedel's attorney, the Riveters accused the two women of torture. The Riveters have denied all of these accusations and said they had never given evidence to defend the four young children who had been executed.

It should also be noted that the Riveters and Riedel have not ruled out either a defint visit via the International Criminal Court or a court case.

A Riedel, who works as an expert on crime, has denied the allegations.

The Riveters have claimed that they paid for their daughter to be raped by the cops. A Riedel, who does not want to be identified for fear of being prosecuted for sexual assault, is also not a rape victim.

The two women have repeatedly asked the Riveters not to visit the hospital.

A police report in response to the Riveters' request stated that, although the Riveters say it was necessary to leave the hospital and that they had gone to the hospital after the alleged rape, they were told there was no threat of rape against the woman being forced to leave. They asked if the ""confidential nature of her request may have been a lie"" and why she had not told anyone to leave the hospital.

The prosecutor's office also has since stated that the Riveters have never said rape was not something they had threatened to kill.

Two women have testified that they were raped in the hospital and the Riveters allegedly wanted to leave the hospital.

In the absence of any information about the rape, the prosecutor's office has said this: ""We are now examining whether we have been charged with rape and other human rights violations and to provide the prosecution with more information for prosecution.""<|endoftext|>SACRAMENTO ?

"Los Angeles Sheriff?s Deputies Fatally Shoot a Black Man They Say Had a Gun to Forgot Hire

The death of Davis was a surprise: video evidence. That not only may have caused conflicting accounts, but also often infuriated law enforcement that could not have been more different.

The Dallas Times story: Laminater shot suspect because he did not wear badge

Davis was shot and killed by Dallas County Sheriff's Deputy Jordan Reid on Feb. 13 during an illegal parking ban, deputies said.

Reid had announced that several people showed up in a confrontation that took place inside the 10600 block of Lake Lippo Road after hearing Davis talking about a gun. No one was hurt.

Davis was lying on his back as the deputies came to his vehicle to confront him. But when the deputies turned, Davis and Reid shot each other in the arm.

Reid then began taunting the deputy for refusing to let Davis go, this time involving his waist belt and other equipment, said Mike Montgomery, deputy chief of the sheriff's deputies at the time.

Davis was removed from his vehicle, his gun in his hand, when he decided to leave his personal belongings in his own car, Montgomery said.

Reid approached Davis and shouted, ""Mr. Davis is taking my guns away!""

Davis appeared unharmed, he said, and was only required to carry a permit. He said he did not know where he was.

Davis later told a friend that he and the deputy reached a cul-de-sac after and then locked up again, Montgomery said. He kept asking Reid to get him out.

""When he told me to, there was no pain on his part, no cause,"" Davis said. ""It was very conscious.""

Witnesses said the chase began in the early morning hours of Feb. 13 when a female shopper fired six shots into the car. According to Dallas Police, a male picked up the officers around 1 a.m. and left about five minutes later to retrieve the stolen gun.

The ensuing chase began outside the store, the officials said.

Davis ran out of his vehicle, yelling at Reid to let the officers get him out of his vehicle, said Montgomery.

No one was injured in the crash and no officers were injured, police said.

No one at Davis' previous criminal court hearing heard from the officer who fired the shots in the store. The deputy tried to pull the dog away.

Davis and Reid, however, were seen walking into Lubbock Civic Center when officials released their original 911 call that Reid threatened to shoot them because they did not wear the badges they use in the city, Montgomery said.

The second 911 call also suggested that Reid was trying to flee the scene, and that Davis wanted to carry out a warrant-of-personification, although Montgomery declined to confirm this.

Davis also told deputy Trevor Clemmons, an investigator with the DART Metro police department, to tell them to get Davis back on the case, Montgomery said.

Then they pulled up, Montgomery said.

Davis eventually got out and pulled onto the pavement again, removing his flash. The deputies took him to the Central Evidence Trail and into a ravine.

Reid looked at Davis with a changed face and was leaning over the truck when the deputies pulled him over, Montgomery said.

""Reid then took him out and then around the 4:15 p.m., a second deputy [followed], began demanding his vehicle. The deputy knocked him down in his passenger seat to then pull him over,"" Montgomery said.

The five left to attempt to get into the back of a car, but only stopped when they ran into a 12-story house that was making too much noise to them, Montgomery said.

A search of the house revealed several weapons ? guns, ammunition, a pack of six 4.56-caliber handguns and.38 caliber pistol, plus ammo ? but no marijuana or loose instruments, Montgomery said.

Nearby, the sheriff's deputy identified one of the sheriff's deputies as Steve Crohn of the 16300 block of South Powell Road.

The two also seemed not to know each other after Davis was shot, police said.

"Welcome to Poll Watch, our weekly look at polling data and survey research on the candidates, voters and issues that will shape the 2020 election.Just over a month ago, the term ?defund the police? was almost entirely the domain of activists and academics. Nowÿit?s a household phrase, with a huge majority of Americans telling pollsters they recognize it.But what exactly does it mean? And when Americans hear it, what do they think of? For proponents of police reform, is it a useful slogan ? or dangerously alienating?In the immediate aftermath of George Floyd?s killing in late May at the hands of Minneapolis police officers, calls to sharply cut police funding appeared potentially radioactive. Beyond some high-profile progressive figures, including a number of young politicians of color, few leading Democrats embraced the term.Joseph R. Biden Jr., the party?s presumptive presidential nominee, staked out his position early last month: ?I do not support defunding police,? he wrote in a USA Today op-ed article, pushing a range of reforms instead.But as people have learned more about the term and some city governments have even put it into action, Americans have shown some receptiveness to it. Recent polling suggests that many Americans have come to understand the phrase as a callÿnot to simply eliminate the keepers of the peace, but to reinvest a portion of their funding in other programs and crime prevention techniques.Running for Congress in New York, Mondaire Jones ? a progressive political newcomer who appears poised to win his still-undecided election in a suburban district ? articulated that vision last month, when he endorsed ?defunding police and reinvesting this money in health, education, and alternatives to incarceration.?Pollsters at PerryUndem, a public opinion research firm, have been studying the public?s response to the protests, and they said they had found voters ? particularly Democrats ?ÿmore curious about than dismissive of the term.?It had such an initial backlash that people had to explain: ?Well, no, here?s what it means,?? Tresa Undem, a partner with the firm, said in an interview. ?It was a small window when a lot of learning happened, and it?s these windows when things change.?Polls have consistently shown that an overwhelming share of Americans see racism as a big problem in the country, and that a slimmer but still-strong majority view Mr. Floyd?s death as part of a systemic problem with policing in America. In a Kaiser Family Foundation poll last month, 74 percent of Americans said ?police violence against the public? was a problem, with 42 percent calling it a major one.Over all, support for the protests against racial injustice continues to run high. In various recent national surveys, roughly six in 10 respondents have expressed favorable views of the protesters. And Americans generally express support for overhauling police practices. The Kaiser poll found that two-thirds supported banning chokeholds, while roughly three-quarters supported increasing transparency around police misconduct and making it easier for victims of excessive force to sue departments.But protesters? central demand has to do with more than reform. They are arguing for undoing and rethinking the way crime is approached in America. And their demands show little sign of going away.Councils in cities across the country have committed over the past month to reducing funding for police departments, or even restructuring them entirely. In New York, the City Council passed a budget this week that shifts $1 billion away from the Police Department. Activists criticized it for using a budgetary maneuver to shift around ? rather than eliminate ? some funding, but it does require the city to abandon plans to hire over 1,000 new officers.And the very fact that city leaders felt compelled to say they were removing funding from the department marked a huge political shift, grounded in public opinion.Jawanza James Williams, the director of organizing for Vocal-NY, which has been instrumental in the push to defund the New York Police Department, said organizers were seeking to ensure that calls to defund the police were always understood in tandem with calls to reinvest in other aspects of city government.?I?m sure ?abolishing slavery? was toxic at the time, for most people in the country,? Mr. Williams said. ?The work is to help people understand the depth of the ?defund? framework, and to inform that with other factors.?People of varying racial backgrounds tend to express a positive view of their local law enforcement agencies, according to many polls. And Americans usually balk at proposals to cut basic funding from the police. In an Associated Press/NORC poll last month, when asked simply whether they supported reducing funding for police departments, just 25 percent of Americans said yes, 53 percent said no, and 21 percent said neither, suggesting they hadn?t made their minds up yet.A Fox News poll taken around the same time asked the question a little differently: Would people support taking money away from police departments and putting it toward ?mental health, housing, and other social services?? In that case, 41 percent of voters expressed support, while 46 percent opposed it. Significantly, even though ?neither? wasn?t an option, 12 percent of respondents refused to say either way.With such a large share of the country still figuring out where it stands on the issue, there is the potential for either side to seize control of the narrative. President Trump has demonstrated that he sees an opportunity to win some ground here, tweeting frequently of his opposition to ?defund the police.?In mid-June, sounding assured that he had the political upper hand, he wrote on Twitter: ?Many Democrats want to Defund and Abolish Police Departments. HOW CRAZY!?Still, as protests have led to legislative results in some cities, they have also helped shift attitudes. A Siena College poll of New York late last month found that a slim majority of the city?s residents would support a reduction in funding for the police. (The question did not mention anything about redirecting funding toward social services.) When asked directly about ?defund the police,? New Yorkers were more split: Forty-one percent supportive, 47 percent opposed.But when asked if mental health professionals should come along when police officers respond to calls dealing with homelessness, drug addiction or mental illness, almost nine in 10 New York City residents said yes.In its recent research, the PerryUndem team was struck by how relatively unformed ? and therefore influenceable ? opinions remained on the meaning, as well as the validity, of calls to ?defund the police.?PerryUndem?s survey was conducted with the online polling firm YouGov, using what is known as a non-probability panel of respondents, whose composition may not perfectly reflect the makeup of the country. Therefore, the survey?s exact numbers must be taken with a grain of salt. But its findings were striking. Americans were more likely to say that they interpreted ?defund the police? to mean taking some funding away from departments and deploying it in ?other ways to make communities safer,? rather than simply removing money that the police need.But neither position was identified by a majority of respondents, and a significant share said they still weren?t sure how to interpret the term.?When you see that, you see an issue that?s very fluid, and I think it can go different directions as this issue and debate continues,? said Mike Perry, also a partner at the firm. ?How the debate continues to take shape ? it could move people in either direction.?",human
"Some protest movements become defined by three- or four-word slogans. The battle cry of Occupy Wall Street was, ?We are the 99 percent.? The current wave of protests has, ?Defund the Police.?Some progressives have suggested that ?transform the police? would be a better slogan, but that seems exactly wrong. ?Transform? can mean anything or nothing. ?Defund? means ?reallocate money from their budgets to other services.? The only ambiguity is how much money to reallocate.As for right-wing critics, we?re talking about people who?ve spent the last decade reinterpreting the phrase, ?black lives matter? ? an obvious expression of outrage at the devaluing of black life in a society that tolerates brutal racial inequality and lets police officers get away with murder ? as a statement that nonblack lives don?t matter.The underlying reasoning behind ?Defund the Police? is simple: many of the conflict resolution functions currently performed by police officers can be transferred to counselors, social workers, and other public employees whose job descriptions don?t involve the use of violence. There?s no reason that the cops need to be called because a homeless woman passed out in a hotel lobby or a mentally ill man is having an episode. Slashing the budgets of police departments and boosting the budgets of other services could result in far fewer situations ending in violence.Still, we should be wary of making the case for ?Defund the Police? in a way that implicitly accepts the limits imposed on our collective imaginations by decades of neoliberalism. I recently saw one of my favorite members of Congress making exactly that mistake.?Defund? means that Black & Brown communities are asking for the same budget priorities that White communities have already created for themselves: schooling > police,etc.People asked in other ways, but were always told ?No, how do you pay for it??So they found the line item.? Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) June 9, 2020Unfortunately, we could reduce the line item for police departments to zero without achieving these goals. A little back-of-the-napkin math is sobering.In Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez?s hometown, the police budget is $5.9 billion dollars. As of last month, Mayor Bill de Blasio had already called for an $800 million reduction to the schools? funding, and lawmakers were warning that cuts of about another $2 billion were on their way. It would take reallocating well over half of the New York Police Department budget just to head off those cuts.Let?s say that funding was instead hiked by $2 billion ? a lot of money in most contexts but a pretty modest boost to the $34 billion pre-cut budget for New York City public schools. (One point of comparison: the spending gulf between the poorest and wealthiest school districts in New York ?now approaches $10,000? per pupil.)So far we?ve reallocated $4.8 billion from the $5.9 billion budget, and we haven?t even dramatically improved the schools. We also haven?t hired a single counselor or social worker outside the education system. We certainly haven?t created any job programs or done anything for the sixty thousand homeless men, women, and children sleeping in the city?s shelters every night.The picture doesn?t get any better if we zoom out to the rest of the country. As Eric Levitz notes, the United States as a whole spends $115 billion on policing, while the estimated price tag of providing ?high-quality social housing for all who want it? is $250 billion. The Bernie Sanders campaign put the annual cost of Bernie?s Medicare for All plan at $3.2 trillion.Indeed, as scholars like John Clegg and Adaner Usmani argue, part of the reason why elites opted for a more violent and aggressive regime of policing and incarceration several decades ago was that it was a cheaper way of managing the social ills caused by poverty than expanding the welfare state.Reallocating funds from the police departments that soak up so much of city budgets is absolutely necessary. But we?re making a mistake if we think we?ve ?found the line item.? Rearranging the money already in municipal budgets is going to leave most poor and working-class neighborhoods of color still woefully underfunded.Solving that requires taking on the entrenched power of the 1 percent. We?re going to have to soak the rich.",human

"Calls for Transforming Police Run Into Realities of Governing in Minnesota

Just when I thought I was going to write this, I found myself not at all writing about the biggest issues plaguing the police state of Minnesota. A far cry from the many well-known factotums of corporate front groups, membership boards, media outlets, and local political consultants churning out nightly coverage of the recently fired executives of police unions, which happen to be around this wonderful stream of mainstream media, marching in front of U.S. Capitol steps on and around the country, pleading for their removal from office, pleading for their judicial disbarment, pleading for their resignation.

As many of you may know, the Minneapolis Police Association's stance on removing that patron of the police has long been questioned as being anti-police.

I originally wrote about it on April 13, 2016, but yesterday I found a copy of the proposed termination order I submitted. I also contacted those who joined through Facebook and Twitter, and has received lots of letters, questions, and outraged responses.

The MPA's leader Chris McGuire, of the Chantilly-based Center for Digital Democracy (CCDA), tweeted,

But-watch: When ""Canada Issues Officers Bill Changes to Police Choice,"" RT @hydraffic of Political Patience gave one away.

I've just met with the top advocate for the Police Service and they're saying the same thing: the RTA should remove six members, and even then, the case won't make a dent in the voir dire position to retain an elected police commander in Minneapolis. Maybe the MPA will not be as assiduously looking at an upstart union or judge as the A$APT Local 10 does when its members don't support police reform, especially when it's inside the ""progressive"" bill caked in budget strings, political donations, people being deemed villains, and online prostitution.

The MPA also has a policy stating, ""It is the policy of this Town and City Council meeting to remove from members that are not reflective of the traditions of the United State of Minnesota and/or our diverse community."" Yes, the phrase has changed on its own, but there has been no mention of the 2010 Ryerson Police Board.

According to several mainstream media organizations like Sky News, the Chicago Tribune, and the Minneapolis Star Tribune, ""The recent resignation of at least five Minneapolis police officers led to less than two weeks of news coverage, had Minneapolis police be reimbursed for services, or face it's criminal charges if prosecutors sought immunity from criminal prosecution for their role.""

Clearly those data points from Minneapolis police officials state there was plenty of attention paid to the ""role of women and youth"" in reducing crime in Minneapolis. However, that $300,000 in help for Minneapolis Police would come from a potential overspending on salaries, rather than delivering real reform of the police force. The problem with coverage of these issues, of course, is the disconnect between the relevant law-enforcement issues and the heated debates around them, and when you ask in real time what action is the ultimate solution to be taken on police violence? For example:

"This is a transcript of a talk given by criminologist Alex Vitale for Jacobin?s YouTube political education series ?Stay at Home.? You can watch the original talk, along with a question-and-answer session, here and subscribe to our YouTube channel here. The talk has been edited for clarity and length.After the police murders of Mike Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, and so many others, we were told by the Obama administration, local mayors, and police chiefs, ?Don?t worry. We see there?s a problem, but we?re going to fix it. We?ve got a set of reforms that are going to make it all better. We?re going to give the police implicit bias training, de-escalation training, mindfulness training. We?re going to hold a series of police-community encounter sessions, where we?re going to talk about racism and apologize for past wrongdoings, and at the end maybe we?ll take a knee together.?We?re going to give everybody body cameras; we?re going to create some early warning systems to identify those bad apples so that we can weed them out. And then the public will have more trust in the police, so the police can get back to doing the important work that they need to do.?That is almost exactly what President Obama said earlier this week in his town hall: that we need to go back to those reforms of five years ago, because we didn?t quite do enough of it. We need to get more buy-in; we need to have more police-community encounter sessions, and that will fix policing.But Minneapolis has done all of this already. The city actually wrote a report in 2018 detailing all the fantastic procedural reforms that they had adopted, the whole menu from the Obama task force on twenty-first-century policing ? the highest expression of what we call ?procedural justice.? And what all these reforms share is this idea that the problems of policing are problems of professionalism and individual-level bias, and maybe a lack of transparency and formal accountability systems. And if we just fix those things, then policing can go back to its normal function of preserving law and order.But what these procedural reforms fail to account for is the fact that the problems are in what the police are tasked with doing ? not how they are doing it.Part of the reason we make this mistake is that we?ve been driven by a growing number of horrific individual incidents of extreme police violence and murder. But the problems of policing are about so much more than that. The problems of policing are about over-policing. And over the last five years, as all these reforms have been implemented, we have seen no change to that problem of over-policing. And there hasn?t even been any reduction in the levels of police violence and killings.We have almost nothing to show for the tens of millions of dollars that we?ve pumped into the budgets of American police to fix policing.The anger we see on the streets in Minneapolis and across the country is in part an expression of that frustration, about the fact that we were sold a bill of goods ? that these mayors trotted out these reforms to placate our movements, so that we would go to sleep and they could go back to waging a war on drugs, and a war on crime, and a war on gangs, and a war on immigrants, and a war on terror, as they always have; to flood our schools with police, to turn drugs into a criminal justice issue, to drive the homeless and those with mental health challenges into the jails.This is not a solution to our society?s problems ? it?s a way of papering over them, of trying to build legitimacy for a political and economic system that is producing mass homelessness, producing mass untreated mental illness, producing mass drug death.It?s time that we quit trying to make police friendlier, nicer, more law-abiding.We don?t need to give narcotics officers antibias training to deal with the racism in the war on drugs. We need to end the war on drugs. But our political leaders are not willing to take that on.They continue to push austerity policies, in which government resources are used to push wealth up the ladder, to subsidize the most successful parts of the economy, in hope that the results will magically trickle down to the rest of us. Well, I?ve been a public employee in a union of the state of New York for twenty years now, and I haven?t seen any trickle-down yet. That?s part of the frustration we see today.We have to rethink the way in which we turn every social problem into a problem for the police to solve. We use criminalization as an alternative to having a decent social welfare system, a social safety net, and economic opportunities for people that are distributed more evenly.How do we get out of this mess? We?ve got to take away the police?s toys ? take away their units, take away their overtime, and reduce police?s head count, ideally in a very targeted way, where we eliminate specific functions like school policing and redistribute those resources into public goods that will actually make schools better learning environments for our children. In New York City, we have five thousand NYPD personnel in city schools ? more than all counselors and social workers combined. We don?t need that.What we need is more counselors, more social workers, more teachers? aides, more high-quality extracurricular activities. And we need to rethink the whole reliance on zero-tolerance disciplining systems that are driven by high-stakes testing regimes, where everyone is doing rote learning by the book. We need to enliven the experience for children, and we need to involve them in the production of a safe school environment instead of criminalizing them.The ?defund the police? movement that we see taking off across the country is the expression of a lot of these ideas that have been percolating across the country for years. I am part of a movement of organizations on the ground, in cities across the country, who have been pushing back against this program of mass criminalizationÿ? who have been saying, ?We don?t need another jail, we need youth centers. We don?t need school police. We don?t need the police to be in charge of mental health services, we need actual mental health services.?My hope is that what?s happening today across the country will help feed those movements and help build their power. Because I think any movement to create economic and racial justice in the United States has to involve dialing back the power of the carceral apparatus, which is going to be used against us and our movements.",human

While others have compared his potential to the case of the President's open support for gun control, none has proposed any immediate funding to fund the Interior Department's budget until early 2017.

But the lack of changes is likely to deepen tensions over federal spending, threatening to disrupt a popular center's efforts to combat climate change and turn the U.S. into one of the worst polluters on the planet.

McConnell said it is important to avoid the ""scramble"" over gun control and promote open negotiations to enact the law.

"Democratic lawmakers and governors are rejecting changes to the U.S. House and Senate rules that would allow federal grant funds to continue funding Planned Parenthood, the Alliance to Fight Blindness said in a newsletter to CNN.

The moves come weeks before Congress is set to vote on the Senate version of the 2013 federal spending bill.

The House Republican version would cut all grants to Planned Parenthood unless Republicans win a landslide victory, including funding for the five clinics that serve low-income women.

President-elect Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced a long awaited deal in an open congressional debate Thursday to replace the House GOP's budget.

""My administration has a long plan to stop this cruel and discriminatory federal government rule that is cutting funds from Planned Parenthood, which has consistently led to higher cancer rates, fewer cancer births, and lower birthrate than any other federal funding program (except the Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid).""

The Republican version of the 2013 budget would gut almost all funding for Planned Parenthood, which was established as an arm of the United Food and Drug Administration, largely as a reaction to President Barack Obama's 2009 proposal to eliminate the program as soon as possible.

""President Trump is committed to this agreement, as he often does, and I am confident he will do so in every way he can in Congress to restore our country's health care system and ensure we have a more equitable and prosperous system,"" Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said.

Critics of the legislation's impact have said the rule would harm women, especially about breast cancer but also as an option in case they don't get cancer or a form of cancer.

""The government has lost all its power, which is why it seems that it is hurting our communities,"" said David Wylie, a Republican lobbyist for the American Civil Liberties Union. ""We have to be able to see a doctor who has a cancer patient make the recommendation that's wrong and be sure all of it is safe. We know it's one thing to be treated, and one thing to be treated is being in the hospital for breast cancer,"" he added.

The GOP bill would increase the number of federal grants Planned Parenthood has distributed to women since 2009, from $4.59 million to $8.4 million.<|endoftext|>The Republican nominee has made it clear that he is not willing to take on more than 5 percent of the electorate ? a figure that he was careful to lower with his own plans to restrict the vote.

In a rare concession to his opponents, the candidate also said he would repeal Obamacare ? which he calls a ""single payer"" law.

A recent poll by Quinnipiac University found that Trump and his supporters are the most critical voters in California.

But the independent newspaper, the San Francisco Chronicle, which funded the poll, said the poll shows that the majority of Republican voters in the state support the repeal plan. (The poll was conducted from July 14 to April 31.)

The Chronicle asked Republican pollster Bob Hugin about the poll and said a Trump representative would have won. Hugin explained his motivations, and said that would make the election far better.

""If you're wondering what Republicans are comfortable with,"" Hugin told the Chronicle. ""We're tired of the system, tired of the Republican people.""

""Democrats like to call themselves conservative, but they don't have an excuse,"" he said.

He also called for a ""more modest"" repeal of Obamacare.

The poll of more than 9,500 registered California voters was conducted on October 16 and 17, 2018, with 2,500 Democrats, 3,000 Republicans and 9,000 independents in the sample selected. The margin of error was +/- 5 points, 19 times out of 20.

Democrats have been more motivated to vote, but the results aren't as impressive.

The margin of error was 27 times out of 20 total surveys. The rest of the polling errors have been in the context of the presidential race. Overall, Democrats are about a third more likely to be in that situation than Republicans.

The poll surveyed 405 registered California voters and was conducted from July 11 to August 8 on behalf of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the Associated Press and Your Money, with a margin of error of +/- 3 points. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.7 points for all political persuasions, plus or minus 5.4 points for the independent- and Democratic Congressional Committees. Each of the committees' respondents has made no attempt to reach the Republican side through question period.

"After more than a week of protests against police brutality and unrest that left parts of the city burned, a growing chorus of elected officials, civic leaders and residents in Minneapolis are urging the city to break up the Police Department and reimagine the way policing works.?We are going to dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department,? Jeremiah Ellison, a member of the City Council, said on Twitter this week. ?And when we?re done, we?re not simply gonna glue it back together,? he added. ?We are going to dramatically rethink how we approach public safety and emergency response.?At least three others, including the City Council president, Lisa Bender, have also called for taking the Police Department apart.Minneapolis is not the only city asking the question. Across the country, calls to defund, downsize or abolish police departments are gaining new traction after national unrest following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck for nearly nine minutes on a busy Minneapolis street.On Wednesday, Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles announced that he would cut as much as $150 million from a planned increase in the Police Department?s budget. And in New York, Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, and Daniel Dromm, a council member from Queens, vowed even before the latest protests to cut the Police Department?s $6 billion budget, which they noted had been left almost untouched even as education and youth programs faced steep cuts.The calls to redirect money away from the police come as cities face steep budget shortfalls because of the economic fallout from the coronavirus, and as public anger against police brutality has roiled the country. Redirecting funding is one of the few levers that elected officials have over the police, who are frequently shielded by powerful unions and labor arbitrators who reinstate officers fired for misconduct.Mr. Dromm, chair of the city?s finance committee, said that in order to restore some funding to youth programs he was considering a delay in the next class of police cadets and scrutinizing the $700 million in police overtime that has been budgeted for this year. He said the events of recent days ? including police officers? treatment of peaceful protesters ? have shown that years of efforts to reform the department have not succeeded.?The culture in the New York City Police Department has not changed,? he said. ?The white shirts, the commanding officers, they kind of get it and talk the talk, but the average beat cop doesn?t believe in it and we?ve seen this over and over again.?In Minneapolis, calls to dismantle the police are likely to further demoralize a force that already is reeling from the killing of Mr. Floyd, the criminal charges filed against four former officers, looting in the city and the burning of a police precinct.?That?s not the answer,? said Gwen Gunter, a retired lieutenant of the Minneapolis Police Department who is also a member of a black police officers? association.?There?s a part of me that hopes they do succeed,? she said, ?because I want to see how long it takes before they say, ?Oh, no we do need a Police Department.??The Minneapolis police chief, Medaria Arradondo, on Friday pledged to ?continue to work on efforts to improve public trust, public safety and transformational culture change of the M.P.D.? His statement did not address the recent calls to dismantle the department.Those who support the movement to scale back the responsibilities of the police say officers frequently abuse their power and instigate violence rather than prevent it. They say many social welfare tasks that currently fall to armed police officers ? responding to drug overdoses, and working with people who have a mental illness or are homeless ? would be better carried out by nurses or social workers.One model that members of the Minneapolis City Council cite is Cahoots, a nonprofit mobile crisis intervention program that has handled mental health calls in Eugene, Ore., since 1989. Cahoots employees responded to more than 24,000 calls for service last year ? about 20 percent of the area?s 911 calls ? on a budget of about $2 million, probably far less than what it would cost the Police Department to do the work, said Tim Black, the program?s operations coordinator.?There?s a strong argument to be made from a fiscally conservative perspective,? Mr. Black said. ?Public safety institutions generally have these massive budgets and there?s questions about what they are doing.?But handing over one aspect of police work is not a panacea. Eugene has had at least two officers shoot people in the past year.Last year, after a campaign by a group called Durham Beyond Policing, the City Council in Durham, N.C., voted against hiring 18 new police officers and began discussing a ?community safety and wellness task force? instead.Minneapolis took a step in that direction last year when it redirected funding for eight new police officers into a new office for violence prevention.?We have an opportunity to reimagine what the future of public safety looks like,? said Steve Fletcher, a City Council member who pushed that effort. But he acknowledged that the effort to build a viable alternative to the police on social and mental health issues would take years and that no one could be sure what it would look like in the end.?It?s very easy as an activist to call for the abolishment of the police,? said Mr. Fletcher, himself a former activist who protested a 2015 police shooting. ?It is a heavier decision when you realize that it?s your constituents that are going to be the victims of crime you can?t respond to if you dismantle that without an alternative.?Black activists in the city have been calling for the police to be dismantled for years, issuing a report in 2018 that argued that the oppression of poor people and black people was baked into the very founding of the department in 1867. Police reform has roiled politics in the city for years, and politicians who have been seen as slow to reform have been defeated. But only recently have calls to dismantle the police been widely embraced by white leaders in the city.In Linden Hills, a predominantly white Minneapolis neighborhood near a golf course and two lakes that has not seen very many of the overly aggressive police tactics that the city?s black residents complain about, residents acknowledge that the department needs to be significantly reformed. But they have been leery of pledges to abolish the police.?What does that even mean?? asked Steve Birch, the chair of the Linden Hills Neighborhood Council. ?Then who provides the public service of policing? I don?t even know how to answer that.?But in Kingfield, a neighborhood in South Minneapolis not far from where Mr. Floyd died, Chris DesRoches, the president of the neighborhood association, said he supported defunding the department.?The killing of George Floyd has opened the eyes of people to the worst case scenario of police,? he said, adding that the case has created an opportunity ?for white people to start hearing what communities of color and community leaders have been saying all along, which is that the police are an organization which has been actively harmful to our communities.?Mayor Jacob Frey has said he does not support calls to dismantle the department. On Friday, City Council members voted to accept a civil rights investigation by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights and to adopt updates to the Police Department?s use of force policy that include a ban on chokeholds. The topic of eliminating some of the department?s functions was not discussed.Still, council members acknowledged during their debate that something had changed fundamentally in the way that city residents view the police. The University of Minnesota, as well as the school board and the parks department in Minneapolis, decided in recent days to cut ties with the Police Department.Many in Minneapolis have said that Mr. Floyd?s death provided a stark illustration of how far efforts to institute reforms in the wake of the 2015 police shooting of Jamar Clark, a 24-year-old African-American man, had fallen short.After that shooting, police officers received implicit bias training and body cameras. The department appointed its first black police chief. Community policing was emphasized. Policies were rewritten to include a ?duty to intervene? if an officer saw a colleague endangering a member of the public ? a policy that was key to the swift firing and arrest of the four officers involved in Mr. Floyd?s death.But none of those reforms were sufficient to prevent Mr. Floyd?s death.?The fact that none of the officers took the initiative to follow the policy to intervene, it just became really clear to me that this system wasn?t going to work, no matter how much we threw at it,? said Alondra Cano, who heads the City Council?s public safety committee.Ms. Cano, who says she was part of a ?prosecute the police? campaign while she was a college student, acknowledged that it might take years to build viable alternatives. But she said many city residents, some of whom have formed mutual protection neighborhood groups in the wake of the unrest, are ready to try.?There?s a moment of deep commitment that I?ve never seen before, and that gives me latitude as an elected official to start experimenting with other systems,? she said.Matt Furber and Eric Killelea contributed reporting.",human
"It is a measure of how frightfully irrational our times are that the ?defund the police? campaign led by Democrats and Black Lives Matter activists is thriving. It has moved to the mainstream of progressive politics even as the need for effective policing becomes ever more palpable.We are not talkingÿjustÿaboutÿthe rampage that followed the horrific killing of George Floyd, which sent Minneapolis and many other big city hot spots spiraling into rioting and looting. The warning signs have been there forÿa few years, obscure at first but increasingly easy to see.A new breed of progressive prosecutors, many of them backed by the George Soros network and other deep-pocketed leftwing organizations, has taken control in San Francisco, Chicago, Philadelphia and other urban centers.TUCKER CARLSON: BLACK LIVES MATTER IS NOW A POWERFUL POLITICAL PARTY AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BLACK LIVESPhilosophically, they see policing, prosecution and imprisonment as triggers of crime, rather than deterrents against it. They?ve targeted law-enforcement techniques rather than lawbreakers. They adamantly reject the intelligence-based policing and broken windows policies that have given us a generation of record low crime. They?ve eliminated cash bail, which means mandatory release for nonviolent crimes ? with a very elastic definition of ?nonviolent.?Once again, we are seeing ?That ?70s Show,? not the TV program but the phenomenon no one sensible ever wanted to see again: the one where the criminals are back out on the street making mayhem before the police can even finish the paperwork processing the last arrest. Pretty soon, the arrests slow to a trickle, even as the crime increases. Making arrests can be dangerous, and no one wants to take the risk over a pointless gesture.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTERSuch has been domestic tranquility in America since the early 1990s that the decades-long crime wave our nation experienced beginning in 1960s is not in the living memory ? or perhaps even in the historical acquaintance ? of today?s progressive firebrands. They seem to believe that law-and-order is our natural condition rather than our hard-won achievement. They don?t seem familiar with the bad old days, and thus don?t recognize how easilyÿthose daysÿcould return.And they are returning.Violent crime is on theÿrise, andÿwas edging steadily up even before the mayhem of these last two weeks. Obviously, that trend is becoming a spike. On Sunday, May 31, there were 18 murders just in Chicago ?ÿaccording to theÿSun-Times, the bloodiest day since the University of Chicago?s Crime Lab began keeping data over 60 years ago.The Windy City is a critical part of this discussion because it illustrates a point the ?defund the police? crowdÿconceals, ostracizing whoever dares mention it:ÿEliminating police departmentsÿwould do the most damage to minority communities.To be sure, there are some corrupt police officers, some who engage in excessive uses of force. Congress, along with state and municipal legislatures, needs to explore how we can discipline, fire, sue and otherwise discourage them. Public employee union contracts that protect bad cops ? as well as bad teachers, and other bad ?public servants? ? need to be scrutinized to the extent they make it very difficult, if not impossible, to take disciplinary action, including termination.For decades, moreover, lawmakers have been AWOL on the issue of ?qualified immunity.? That court-made doctrine undermines lawsuits against wayward cops. Of course, police have to have leeway to make good faith errors. Again, law enforcement is dangerous work. Copsÿhave toÿmake occasional snap judgments, and if they believe they can be sued over bona fide efforts to safeguard the public within the bounds of the law, they will not take the lawful actions we need them to take.While we obsess over the treatment of crime?s perpetrators, it is crime?s victims that merit our most urgent concern.ÿMinority communities are the ones most targeted and most wrongedÿby criminals.Yet, qualified immunity cannot be so sweeping that it enables patent abuses to escape accountability. Figuring out the appropriate line between tolerable police error and actionable police abuse is the job of lawmakers politically accountable to the people whose lives are at stake. They must not continue abdicating to the courts.All that said,ÿthough,ÿpolice encounter minority suspects at higher rates because they offend at higher rates.ÿThe stubborn fact is that this is particularly true of young black males. Though it is fashionableÿto speak of police departments and the criminal justice system as ?institutionally racist,?ÿit is also specious.Over time, police departments more and more reflect the racial and ethnic composition of their communities. In many big cities, top political and law enforcement officials are themselvesÿAfrican-American. And as for the justice system writ large, it is overseen by professionals who graduated from elite American law schools.ÿWith the possible exception ofÿcollege professors, there is no more politically progressive stratum in our society ? and no one prouder to say so than lawyers themselves. The notion that they would abide racism, much less thoroughgoing anti-black racism, in an institution they run would be laughable if the matter were less fraught.We know what offense levels are, not because police are too myopically focused on minority communities, but because crimes have victims.ÿThose victims report crime, or are found injured or killed at crime scenes. This is not a statistical gameÿfitÿfor deducing racism onÿaÿdubious ?disparate impact? theory. This is real life ? and death.While we obsess over the treatment of crime?s perpetrators, it is crime?s victims that merit our most urgent concern.ÿMinority communities are the ones most targeted and most wrongedÿby criminals.Replacing police forces would not be easy, but wealthier communities have the wherewithal to make alternative security arrangements.

"Bill Maher blasts 'Defund the police' branding: How are Dems 'this f---ing stupid'?

Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) slammed Democrats for calling for the imprisonment, claiming that the media's fake narratives are being used to ""defund"" officers.

""Why do they tell the truth about people who refuse to report their assaults to the police?"" he said. ""The fact that if they tell the truth they would be arrested!""

He pointed to the recent release of the officer-involved shooting death of two African-American men, Jason Crawford, in which he argued the police were using a racist playbook to avoid arrest.

""It's only because they can now get out of the country, make sure they don't get arrested, it's all about this phony 'war on terror,'"" he said at a media conference in Arizona. ""The false narrative is just the tip of the iceberg. It could be a real war, if it had been done before the wars started.""

""The fact that they can now get out of the country, make sure they don't get arrested, it's all about this fake 'war on terror,' as well as the false narratives we've seen through the media,"" he added. ""So they are not even trying to change their rhetoric, they're just trying to justify what they are about.""

In an interview with the AP, which aired Monday, Mr. Swalwell said his agency helped ""make sure every police officer is on the beat. It is essential for a good police officer in a troubled state and a good police department."" The Washington Post News Foundation, which reported the story but declined to comment, praised Mr. Swalwell's efforts, calling the statement a ""very effective and effective message.""

Mr. Swalwell said the agency worked hard to highlight the police who have been charged, but that the public should not feel intimidated by reports like ""Officer #38"" that contradict the officers' account of the shooting. ""It is important that people be aware of the fact that there are many cases where this thing goes unanswered and is not going to be fixed,"" he said.

Mr. Swalwell said the AP, like many media organizations, had the power to find ""truth"" but not enough information to know how many cases the authorities ""need to handle.""

""Nobody should take away the power that goes into a police investigation to have their version of events,"" he said. ""The information that goes into any possible investigative process is always something that can be analyzed, and if that's not enough then it's not going to be enough.""<|endoftext|>""The way you do it, we need to do it more.

The problems of poverty started with what he felt was one of the most important national problems of his generation ? an unemployment rate that would almost certainly have gone down to 4.4 percent if he had waited until the right time.

But Hancock later added, ""The way you do it is we need to do it more. We need to do it to more.""

Hospitalization is a significant issue nationally among African Americans with little or no access to high-paying education, especially health care. The 2010 census revealed only one minority of African American patients, white and Hispanic, and almost half of the uninsured population had insurance.

Part of the problem was even worse among young, single men in the black community ? a significant fraction of young black men than older white men.

But despite the city's troubles, African Americans of all ages have the money to support a doctor and an education ? and the same amount of resources to try to help them, Mr. Hancock said.

""I don't even know how to go about stopping the doctors from coming here,"" he said. ""I know how to get my insurance. I'm sure of it.""

At the time of his election in 2012, Mr. Hancock sat in his high school library as a sophomore, watching a ""D.""

""I'll stop being a pretty harsh kid at first,"" he said. ""I don't want to say I wish I had other options. But I'm gonna keep fighting.""

Mr. Hancock was a strong supporter of former presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, and he was also drawn to the nation's largest government-run university system and its efforts to better education reform and social safety nets.

""We want, and should we want our children educated, we want our colleges educated and to be in compliance with universal funding,"" said Mr. Hancock.

At the same time, the budget is a major issue. The Supreme Court's decision of June 12, a majority majority, gave officials powerful power. The decision allowed the state to use",machine
"WASHINGTON ? A month after the killing of George Floyd by the police in Minneapolis ignited a wave of nationwide protests, Democratic Party officials are expressing broad support for significantly reallocating funds away from police departments, with positions that go well beyond that of the party?s presumptive presidential nominee, Joseph R. Biden Jr.Interviews with 54 Democratic National Committee members, convention superdelegates and members of a criminal justice task force convened by Mr. Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders found a near-unanimous sentiment that local governments should redirect more money toward social services, education and mental health agencies.Very few advocate fully defunding or abolishing the police, as some activists have called for. But they are aligning themselves, as have city councils in Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Denver, Portland, Ore., and other cities, with an increasingly popular movement to drastically rethink the priorities surrounding law enforcement.Their views exceed those adopted by Mr. Biden, who opposes defunding but has proposed policing changes and said that federal aid to police departments should be conditioned on meeting ?basic standards of decency and honorableness.? They also go further than what the Biden-Sanders task force will recommend to the party?s platform committee and the Biden campaign later this month, according to several members of the group.?Governments are going to have to look at how they can reallocate money,? said Harry Reid, the former Senate majority leader. ?Of course it?s a good idea if we have more social services rather than police because police are to be our guardians rather than warriors. There are a lot of things we?d rather have a sociologist work through rather than a guy with a gun and a holster.?The issue could prove delicate for Mr. Biden as he works to unite the party?s disparate factions ? including a still-skeptical progressive wing ? into a coalition that can defeat President Trump in November, while rebutting the president?s strategy of attacking Democrats as weak on ?law and order.? There is clear tension not only between Mr. Biden and the party?s base, but between the moderate voters Mr. Biden needs to win the general election and the more liberal voters who populate Democratic primaries.A New York Times and Siena College national poll released this week shed light on the diverging viewpoints. It found 63 percent of registered voters oppose spending less money on the police. But among Mr. Biden?s supporters, 55 percent favor reducing the amount of resources spent on law enforcement.Stacey Walker, a county supervisor from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, whom Mr. Sanders appointed to the criminal justice task force, supports the movement to defund police departments and has been pushing the Biden-Sanders task force toward more sweeping proposals. He suggested that Mr. Biden had not yet caught up to the energy and sentiment that is currently motivating many in the party.?It seems to me right now that the vice president certainly understands the need for police reform, but I think his vision is a little different from some of the progressive activists on the ground,? Mr. Walker said.The activism in the party over law enforcement and racial injustice has already had an impact on Democratic politics. It helped boost Jamaal Bowman to a wide lead over Representative Eliot Engel in a New York primary election on Tuesday, and elevated Charles Booker into position to score an upset in the Kentucky Senate primary.More evidence emerged this week that incremental change isn?t sufficient for Democratic lawmakers, as Senate Democrats blocked a Republican-led effort toward changing police practices that they said did not do enough to address racial inequities.Of the 54 Democratic officials surveyed, only four said they opposed shifting funds away from law enforcement agencies.?When it comes to the police, it seems they have to do every job that is asked of them,? said former Mayor Joseph R. Paolino Jr. of Providence, R.I., who is a member of the D.N.C. ?I feel strongly that they are here to protect us from crime and that they deserve our support.?Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman, said that ?bringing our nation together to overcome systemic racism is at the heart of Joe Biden?s agenda,? adding that Mr. Biden would fight for a range of programs as well as for ?new grants for the community policing that is proven to improve relationships and reduce violence.??He believes policing funding should be conditioned on local law enforcement reforms to stop these horrible tragedies,? Mr. Bates said.The issue of reallocating law enforcement funds is so new to the mainstream Democratic Party discussion that during the entirety of the 2020 presidential primary, not a single major candidate uttered the phrase ?defund the police.?Instead Mr. Sanders touted his tenure as mayor of Burlington, Vt., when he gave police officers pay raises. His campaign was centered on divisions related to economic injustice, rather than the explicit calls for racial justice that have animated the demonstrations since the Floyd killing.?Those of us who supported Bernie in 2016 and this year have a lot to learn about racial justice and policing,? said Larry Cohen, the chairman of the Sanders-aligned group Our Revolution. ?It is a core issue that must be directly addressed and not just as part of broader issues.?Even Juli n Castro, the former Housing secretary who offered the most far-reaching criminal justice proposals among the 28 Democrats who ran for president, didn?t call for spending less money on law enforcement. He said recent events had cast into sharp relief the need to adjust the approach to that issue.?Cities spend a huge portion of their local budgets on traditional armed policing when situations on the ground don?t require traditional armed policing,? said Mr. Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio. ?There?s no question that what?s happened in the last few weeks has channeled, directed and broadened the calls for change.?Demands to reduce police funding range from abolishing departments entirely, and immediately, to phasing out tasks that have long been assigned to law enforcement. Ted Terry, a D.N.C. member who is the former mayor of Clarkston, Ga., called for a 50 percent reduction in police budgets over 10 years. ?Racial justice is absolutely the most prominent and important issue right now,? Mr. Terry said.Yet while his party pushes for allocating fewer resources to police departments, Mr. Biden has proposed directing an additional $300 million toward local law enforcement community policing efforts, funds his campaign said would come with restrictions on use-of-force rules and requirements that departments spend more on social programs.There is some hope among Democrats advocating change that Mr. Biden will eventually adopt policies reversing his career-long direction of funneling more federal funds to police departments.?If he stopped here I wouldn?t be satisfied, but I know that he is evolving,? said Ron Harris, a Democratic National Committee member from Minneapolis. ?He is listening and I anticipate that the more he listens and the more we advocate for these things that he?ll respond accordingly.?The issue has complicated matters on the criminal justice task force that was formed by the Biden and Sanders campaigns after Mr. Sanders dropped out of the race and endorsed Mr. Biden. When it was first convened in mid-May, the group of eight was expected to focus on the decriminalization of marijuana and phasing out the for-profit private prison system.After Mr. Floyd?s killing, the conversation turned toward policing, and the task force has considered proposals as robust as abolishing police departments entirely. In the end, though, the group?s recommendations to the Biden campaign and the D.N.C.?s platform committee will not include reducing money for law enforcement, according to people familiar with its plans.Yet even Mr. Biden?s appointees to the task force said a potential Biden administration should consider what incentives it offers local governments to redirect its law enforcement resources.?You can?t go downstream and say, ?Why aren?t there any fish??? said Raumesh Akbari, a Tennessee state senator from Memphis who was appointed by the Biden campaign to serve on the task force. ?You have to go to the top of the river and figure out what the problem is there.?The Democrats who urge shrinking police budgets say it would reverse decades of policies that have shifted funds away from social services toward police departments.?I support law enforcement, and that means realigning their mandate and stop being asked to respond to the social service needs which our elected officials have ignored for far too long,? said Alma Gonzalez, a Democratic National Committee member from Tampa, Fla.As liberal activists and demonstrators have rallied around the ?defund the police? slogan, President Trump and his Republican allies have argued that a Biden presidency would lead to chaotic scenes across American cities. In an effort to stoke those anxieties, the president has tweeted the phrase ?law & order? 16 times since Mr. Floyd was killed.The vast majority of Democrats interviewed did not seem worried about Mr. Trump?s attacks, and said they saw little risk in having Mr. Trump portray them as weak on law and order issues as long as they were making practical policy proposals for redirecting police funding to other social service agencies. The bigger risk, most of them said, is for Mr. Biden to alienate an energized base ? exposing a potentially damaging schism in his coalition.?We, as black citizens, will no longer accept the minimum from the Democrats,? said Ray McKinnon, a Democratic National Committee member from Charlotte, N.C. ?We will not accept the ?tough on crime? Biden or Clintons. Those days have passed and we demand that black and brown folks are centered.?",human
"The speed with which the demand to ?defund the police? has caught on in response to the mass protests all throughout the country in the wake of the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis has been shocking. And leftist elected officials have often been at the forefront of that call.Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez is the alderwoman of Chicago?s thirty-third ward. Jeanette B. Taylor is the alderwoman of Chicago?s twentieth ward. Both are members of the Democratic Socialists of America and were two of the six signatories on a recent op-ed in the Chicago Sun-Times entitled ?Cutting funding for police could lead to a better and safer Chicago.?The alderwomen spoke with Jacobin deputy editor Micah Uetricht for the Jacobin Radio podcast The Vast Majority. You can listen to the episode here. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.What were your initial reactions to seeing the George Floyd video? And have you all been in the streets with the protests since the video was released?I don?t think I have a way to describe seeing the video. The amount of pain, the disgust, the frustration? Yes, I have been in the streets. I feel like what I have seen in the streets and what I have experienced myself is that shared feeling of rage. That?s what I felt when I saw that video, absolute rage. It has been really cathartic to see people share that rage, and take to the streets and raise their voices.Several people who I love dearly were arrested two Sundays ago in Hyde Park. I showed up at Fifty-first and Wentworth [the Chicago Second District police station], and what I encountered was incredible. There was a crowd of people outside waiting and demanding the release of these activists. When I tried to go inside, I found a police force that was preventing lawyers from going in and talking to their clients. The lawyers were only able to go in because I was there. People were being deprived of access to legal counsel. These people were beat and detained for absolutely no reason.So what we?re seeing in Chicago on the ground is a ridiculous amount of use of force by the police, deploying the police to beat up black and brown people who are on the streets protesting and manifesting that rage that we all feel ? not only because of George Floyd?s murder at the hands of police, but also because of all of the murders that have come forth. Breonna Taylor, for example ? nothing has happened with the officers who killed her. She was in her bed.The video is nothing new to black America. It happens all the time. This time it was videotaped. They?ve been killing black folks for years, and we?ve been saying that it wasn?t right, it was unjust. Now that we have video, the world gets to see just how racist the police system is in this country ? really, how racist this country is altogether.For me, there is fear, there is outrage, of course ? but it?s enough that you get numb after a while because you see it so much. Let?s go back to Rekia Boyd, let?s go to Laquan McDonald ? those are all folks who have been killed by the police. Laquan McDonald?s killer only went to jail because the city of Chicago rose up and said, ?No, he does not get to kill this young man? ? after they lied, after the police superintendent lied, after the mayor lied, after everybody lied after seeing the tape.Too often we are killed and nothing happens. The police department was never meant to serve and protect people of color.I?ve been to some protests. I?ve also had to go to the police station to help people get out of jail. It?s 2020, and I just can?t believe what this country is, but I?m not surprised. You can only do so much to folks and then you get what is happening the last couple of weeks. I don?t agree with looting, but I understand. We?re in a pandemic, and people have been working almost three months, and you give them twelve hundred dollars ? what did they expect was going to happen?And then you have a mayor [Lori Lightfoot] who is supposed to be progressive, who won?t defund the police or even say it; she?s too busy thanking the police. You?ve got generations of folks who are owed an apology, and we won?t get it.You are two of the six signatories on an op-ed that was recently published in the Chicago Sun-Times, calling for defunding the police. Give us the basic case: why is defunding the police an important demand to put forward at this moment?Because the police are not designed to solve the problems that people are facing. Police are not meant to protect people ? particularly people of color. If you want to have safe communities, if you want to keep people protected, we all need things like jobs ? decent-paying, jobs with benefits and job security, and jobs that are fulfilling. People need housing. Nobody that does not have a roof over their head is safe. People need support services. People need mental health services. We have a police force that is being called mostly to address nonviolent crimes. People deserve to have their needs met, and the police don?t meet any of those things.If we want to see safe communities, if we want to see communities that are whole, we need to start investing in the things that we know are going to keep people safe and address their quality of life.We have to start by investing in black communities and the communities that have been most devastated by the logic of austerity that has taken so many resources from social services and the safety net, and then put it at the service of punishment, imprisonment, and mass incarceration. If we?re really saying that we care about black lives, if we say black lives matter, if we say that we care about our communities, we had better start investing in those communities and in the things that actually make us safe.In the op-ed, you mention numbers that are similar to other cities in the country, but are still staggering to think about. Forty percent of the City of Chicago?s budget is spent going to the Chicago police department (CPD). The city spends five million dollars on policing every day. Those figures don?t even include the more than half a billion dollars in police misconduct settlements paid out in Chicago alone in the past nine years, which sounds like a number that you would hear in the federal budget, not just in the budget for one city?s police brutality cases.If you compare the amount of money we?re putting toward policing ? for example, in the 2020 budget, we have roughly $1.8 billion allotted for the police. Then, you have all the social service agencies together ? the Department of Family & Support Services, the Chicago Department of Public Health, the libraries, the Commission on Human Relations, offices for people with physical disabilities ? which have roughly $1 billion to split between all these agencies. But we have $1.8 billion for policing in Chicago. That contrast is just so stark.What are you saying to our communities when you?re saying ?I?m going to invest all of this money in policing you, and only this amount in giving you the support that you need??Are you surprised at how quickly the demand to defund the police has become such a rallying cry around the country? Two weeks ago I would have assumed that such a demand was necessary, but not one huge numbers of people would get behind. And yet here you all are in the Sun-Times, making this case. There?s suddenly traction all over the country in local governments to defund the police. Do you find that surprising?No. I?m not going to pay people to kill me and my kind, period. It?s not a question. And any elected official that says anything different doesn?t deserve to serve the public. It?s not just people of color. You have all these Caucasian brothers and sisters that are protected by the Chicago Police Department and by police departments across the country saying ?no, we are not paying for our people to get killed. They are human like we are. We are not going to do this.?It?s hilarious that we?re protesting police brutality and we?re still getting beat up, doing these protests. Can somebody explain that to me?You would think that when police are being protested for something, they wouldn?t do the thing that they?re being protested for in response to the protests.The president of the Chicago Police Board got beat up at a Hyde Park protest. The Chicago Police Board president is a black gentleman named Ghian Foreman. I have the pleasure of knowing Ghian. Politically, sometimes I don?t agree with him, but he?s a really smart brother. The same protest where we had to get our young people who are in community organizations out of the police station, when [the police] attacked them, they attacked [Ghian] and did not know that he was the president of the police board. Why? Because he is a black man.So I don?t care if you become the president, the president of the police board, a congressman, or a senator. You are not exempt from the racist practices done by the Chicago Police Department.What have your non?Democratic Socialists of America members, non?community organizer activist?type city council colleagues been saying in response to these demands to defund the police?Right now we?re lucky that we have a voice that we have never had before in city council. There are six of us that are behind the demand to defund the police. But we have other progressive colleagues that are having these conversations with us as well.Of course, a huge amount of council members are not entertaining this idea, and are not willing to engage with this conversation. We need to continue to push so that this conversation is had. It is being had in New York, it?s being had in Los Angeles. It is definitely being led in Minnesota. We can?t ignore this. We are elected and the people are out in the streets telling us what they want us to do.The mayor is currently talking about training. We know that the Chicago police are getting trained. I personally know people who are doing a lot of training around de-escalation and black history. There are people having peace circles with police officers in the CPD.If you don?t change the material conditions for people, you?re going to keep having the same situation, because that is what the police were designed for. We don?t necessarily have the support of a majority in the city council, but we?re going to have to make sure that this conversation is had.What has been the reaction from your own constituents around this demand? Do you feel like there is a clamor to defund the police from the people in the communities that you all represent? Is it mixed? Are there some people who definitely do not want to push for that demand?I have never gotten so many emails supporting something that I?ve been putting forward! I?ve never gotten so many emails from people saying ?we agree with you, we need to defund the police.?We created a survey, and we?re putting it on our website to let people tell us what their thoughts are around policing. As soon as we have a good amount of responses in our survey, I?m going to make it public so that people can see what our community is saying about this. But all I have gotten are emails from people agreeing with defunding the police and supporting [the Civilian Police Accountability Council (CPAC)].One of the things I ran my campaign on was CPAC. We see police brutality every day in the simplest ways. The summer I ran [for office in 2019], a young man was killed at the corner store and the police were laughing. Just imagine seeing your friend lying on the ground, and the police laughing ? then the store itself clean up the blood and open up like nothing happened. That?s the reality you see too often in my community.So I?ve gotten a host of emails that say ?defund the police.? I can?t do anything but adhere to that. I?ve got three black boys, and I tell people all the time: when I see [a call on my cell phone that looks like it could be coming from a police station], my heart drops, because it?s always the thought that this is going to be that call to tell me somebody?s shot one of my kids. That?s not a reality that a white mother has in the city of Chicago. Why is it mine?And I?m really tired of the rhetoric of ?It?s a few bad apples.? [Fellow Minneapolis police officers] watched that police officer put his knee on George Floyd?s neck. The force stood by and watched. This is the one reason I could never support [former CPD] Superintendent Eddie Johnson, because he?s going to say ?if there?s a ?code of silence? [within the CPD], I?ve never seen it.? Well, you must be blind.You all have brought up Mayor Lori Lightfoot. Can you talk about what her response to these protests and what the demands to defund the police has been?We have seen an increased presence of police everywhere. We have seen the use of the National Guard in Chicago, and something that looks like a militarized state; we have seen a lot of police brutality; we have seen cases upon cases of people who have been unjustly arrested and beaten up; and I am sure that we?re going to be seeing a lot of lawsuits.Don?t forget about the private security [the mayor] purchased.We just saw her hire a private security company with $1.2 million, which we just don?t understand. We?re saying that we don?t have money, we?re broke, but we can find money like magic for policing our communities! It?s just incredible ? $1.2 million, just like that. Overnight. I?m going to hire a private company who has lots of shady issues and give them this money to keep us ?safe,? when we have seen that the protests have been mostly peaceful.The response has been really repressive. I don?t understand why we are still not having a conversation about defunding police when this is being talked about in every other major city in the United States.Has she explicitly rejected the demand to defund the police?Yes, we had a press conference on Friday. Jewel-Osco [a local grocery store chain] is donating a million dollars to a rebuild fund, and they made the announcement in my ward. It took everything in me not to get out of my seat and walk out of the press conference. She said out of her mouth, ?I?m not going to defund the police.? There wasn?t a question about it; she didn?t think about it.When she decided to hire this private firm, she didn?t have a conversation with us. When she brought the National Guard to the city to protect the downtown area, there was not a conversation with us. We are not a part of the conversation. She has executive power, and you?ve got to remember: we?re two of the aldermen who voted not to give her that power. [Mayor Lightfoot recently passed a sweeping bill that gives her new executive power to respond to the coronavirus pandemic that was passed over the opposition of twenty-one of the city?s fifty city council members, citing concerns that the new measures would reduce the mayor?s democratic accountability to the council.] We knew that they were going to spend money out the wazoo and not talk to the people.See, people have a misconception. We don?t work for Lori Lightfoot. We?re her coworkers. She clearly doesn?t understand that. I don?t work for her! I work for the citizens of Chicago in the twentieth ward. Rossana works for the thirty-third ward citizens. We make decisions for our wards. We live here, she doesn?t; and clearly she doesn?t understand that, which is why, even before this happened, there was so much contention between the aldermen and her.Mayor Lightfoot has portrayed herself as a progressive mayor. This is a buzzword that a lot of people want to affix to themselves lately. What is your response to that characterization of her and her tenure as ?progressive??[Extended laughter]You can?t say you?re progressive and, at the same time, be throwing police at protesters that are saying ?black lives matter, we don?t want any more police brutality.? You can?t call yourself a progressive when you leave teachers out for eleven days, going on strike for things as basic as social workers and nurses. I?m sorry ? I can?t agree with the idea of somebody that says that they?re progressive but their actions don?t reflect that. And, granted, progressive is a word that can stretch a lot!Who doesn?t like ?progress,? right? Nobody?s against progress.Right now, defunding the police is not a radical demand. That is good government. The idea of funding public services and making sure that people have their needs met ? that?s just good government. How can you say that you?re progressive if you?re not even entertaining the idea of having that conversation?She doesn?t even want to have the conversation. She has decided that all communities have been asking her for more officers, more policing in their communities, and she?s not going to take resources away from policing. Well, I am having a lot of people tell me that they want us to defund the police and reinvest that money, so she?s clearly not listening to some people. I don?t know if she?s making a political calculation about who votes and who doesn?t vote, and who is ultimately going to keep her [in office].But what I?m seeing is a lot of support for taking resources from policing and punishment, and putting them into services that will improve the lives of people.This week there was an amazing turnabout on the part of Mayor Bill de Blasio in New York City, who last week was saying that he would not defund the New York Police Department. Then, all of a sudden, this week, after incredible scenes of horrific police violence and the clear effect that people are not leaving the streets and not abandoning this demand, de Blasio seemed to be changing his tune.It raises the obvious question about Chicago, and whether the mayor here, perhaps in response to similar, continued mass numbers of people in the streets, will also eventually change her mind about this demand to defund the police.That has been pretty remarkable. We also saw Mayor de Blasio completely justify how his police officers ran over protesters. The pressure that has been created by these protests is just way too powerful. It is really hard for anybody who is elected right now to ignore this moment.The demand for defunding the police is obviously about taking resources away from the police and directing money to other social policies that could actually benefit people?s lives and create real safety for them.You two represent two very different districts in Chicago, but two districts that could use additional resources. If there were to be a defunding of the Chicago Police Department, and new money was freed up in the Chicago budget, what would you all want to see those resources be used for in the communities that you represent?Education, housing, and employment. Education is fundamental to everything. Whatever you want to become, you need to be educated. Why is the money not going into that?I?m in a community that will be gentrified because of the Obama presidential library. Why would you not put in housing? I have a population of homeless teens that live in my community. There are plenty of places you can put it.The reason why young people don?t have anything to do is because there?s no money in social services. There?s no money in after-school programs. There?s no money in summer programs. There are plenty of places that money could go, if we?re talking about helping a generation that we?ve neglected. This is the same generation that had to deal with school closings in fifty major [schools]. This is the same generation whose mental health clinics we closed. This is the same generation whose bare necessities we took away.What I tell folks is: this is just like a cat. Your cat loves you, but back it into a corner and see what happens. He?s going to come out scratching. And so that?s what we?re seeing in all of these major cities around the country. These folks are tired, and they should be.We need housing. I have a huge homeless population in my ward. We need jobs, particularly for young people. We need a lot of money invested in education and restorative justice for our schools. We need mental health services. I have a huge undocumented population in my community that doesn?t benefit from a lot of resources, so putting those resources in places like schools, where everybody is able to access them, is going to be really important. We need to be able to provide a lot of those services through institutions that are going to be able to cater to the undocumented community.We also need to strengthen the fabric of our communities. There are a lot of things we can be doing in order to do that. It has become really evident through COVID-19 that we don?t have a social safety net. There was nothing in place when, all of a sudden, people started losing jobs, and couldn?t pay their rent, and people were scared that they were going to get evicted. We have seen an incredible response from the communities, creating mutual aid networks incredibly fast so that we can address the needs of the people. That work needs to be done also by the government.",human

"Good morning and welcome to On Politics, a daily political analysis of the 2020 elections based on reporting by New York Times journalists.Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.Protesters demand a law enforcement restart, but Biden and the Democrats back reform ?ÿwhile Trump backs, well, the police. It?s Tuesday, and this is your politics tip sheet.Defund,ÿor just reform? That is the question now at the heart of this moment. Protesters,ÿalong with progressive elected officials around the country,ÿare demanding that police departments be defunded, disbanded and replaced by a newly anti-racist system of public safety and justice. In Minneapolis, there are already signs that such a drastic change could soon occur.Proponents of a more moderate approach support new measures to exert oversight over police departments and regulate the use of force, but not break up the departments. Democratic leaders in the House backed this approach yesterday when they unveiled a sweeping police-overhaul bill amid fanfare on Capitol Hill. The bill would make it easier to prosecute officers accused of wrongdoing and would put new restrictions on the use of force.Where does all this leave Joe Biden, theÿpresumptive Democratic nominee for president? Just a few weeks ago, he was still adamantly defending his support for the 1994 crime bill ? a law that put 100,000 new police officers on the street, and spent nearly $10 billion on prisons.Biden?s campaign will probably walk a fine line on matters of policing, as he works to shore up support on the left while courting moderate voters. Yesterday, he threw his support firmly behind the more moderate reformers. ?No, I don?t support defunding the police,? he told CBS News, in a similar statement to the one that recently got Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis booed out of a rally. ?I support conditioning federal aid to police based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness,? Biden said.It?s clear what side President Trump is on. ?There won?t be defunding, there won?t be dismantling of our police, and there is not going to be any disbanding of our police,? he declared on Monday. He spoke alongside law enforcement officials and top members of his administration, including state attorneys general, the national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, the president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police and officials from some police departments. ?You?ll see some horrible things like we witnessed recently, but 99 ? I say 99.9, but let?s go with 99 percent of them ? are great, great people,? Trump said of the police.But polls suggest that Trump?s hard-line stance over the past two weeks has not particularly helped him. In a CNN poll released yesterday, just 38 percent of the country approved of his job performance, his lowest marks since January 2019 ? even as the country proceeds with a cautious economic reopening. And only 31 percent said they liked how he was handling race relations ? roughly on par with past results to this question, and an indication that even some of Trump?s supporters are uncomfortable with his positions on racial issues.According to a new analysis by Nate Cohn of The Upshot, Biden?s lead is up across the board, putting him in a stronger position than any presidential challenger since Bill Clinton in summer 1992. Looking only at theÿmost reliable recent polls conducted by live telephone interviewers, Nate found that Biden is now ahead of Trump by an average of 10 percentage points. That?s a four-point increase compared with polls from the previous month.Amassing by the thousands to march and chant, often densely packed in groups, sometimes embracing, protesters haven?t shown an abundance of caution about the coronavirus. Still, hundreds of public health and disease experts last week signed an open letter arguing that protests were justified, despite the pandemic, because ?white supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to Covid-19.? They called the protests ?vital to the national public health and to the threatened health specifically of black people in the United States.?And for all of those who are worried about mass gatherings contributing to virus transmission, some (relatively) good news arrived yesterday from the World Health Organization. In an analysis based on data obtained through contact tracing, the organization announced that infected people who don?t develop symptoms rarely transmit the virus to others.No, this doesn?t mean that social distancing is unnecessary ? nor that marchers aren?t frequently passing the virus to one another. Experts still say that people who will eventually develop symptoms can in fact become contagious before those symptoms begin to show.Demonstrators in Jackson Heights, Queens, yesterday called for defunding the New York Police Department and investing in schools.You?ve almost certainly heard it by now: The protests are mostly peaceful, and when they?re not, it?s the work of unseemly provocateurs, seeking to either undermine the movement (right-wingers) or glom onto it from the outside (antifa).To our reporter Jacey Fortin, that idea sounded a bit too easy, so she dug into the history of the civil rights movement, where she found countless examples of this type of claim being used against anti-Jim Crow activists in the 1960s.Jacey was kind enough to answer a few questions about the phenomenon, and how it?s playing out today.Hi Jacey. You write in your piece that the trope of the ?outside agitator? has been in circulation since at least the civil rights movement of the 1960s. How did the authorities utilize that claim to curtail the movement?First, I think attributing unrest to roving provocateurs aims to disconnect it from the actual experiences of constituents. In 1965, Sheriff Jim Clark of Dallas County, Ala., sought to draw that line when he said he was sure that ?the local people? would settle down once the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. left the state.Second, it changes the legal context. It?s usually up to states and localities to handle allegations of property damage or violence, but interstate travel can bring federal laws into the picture and justify a harsher response, or surveillance. Attorney General William P. Barr tapped into this idea last month when he warned that it was a violation of federal law to cross state lines ?to incite or participate in violent rioting,? and that the F.B.I. would enforce those laws.In recent weeks, many people who said they supported ?peaceful? protesters ? often, liberals ? argued that demonstrators destroying property and using confrontational tactics were in fact ?agitators,? who didn?t really belong to the movement. Did you find that that?s generally true? Or, in its own way, does that argument serve to sideline a key part of the protesters? message? Just as important, does it obscure the level of urgency and radicalism inherent to their demands?Protesters have disagreed over which tactics are acceptable. Vandalism and looting can call attention to a cause, and they definitely speak to the urgency you mentioned. They can also distract from the peaceful demonstrations and concrete demands that organizers have been working on for years.So I think there?s room for complexity and specificity. It?s possible to acknowledge that some protesters can hurt a movement or bring harm to black neighborhoods or black-owned businesses ? and to call those people out ? without resorting to broad-brush conclusions about the legitimacy of a movement whose roots go back generations.We?ve seen a groundswell of public support for the current protest movement. Would you say that the ?agitator? argument is losing its edge, or is it still something many people believe?Well, I haven?t conducted a national poll on this one! But you covered this issue last week and found ? is it weird if I quote you? ? that ?never before in the history of modern polling have Americans expressed such widespread agreement that racial discrimination plays a role in policing.?I think this speaks less to the efficacy of the ?agitator? argument, and more to the work that activists and organizers have been doing for a very long time to build connections between people experiencing similar things in different places. As the historian Robin D.G. Kelley put it in our conversation for this story, ?If this is a national movement and an international movement, at what point are there really outside agitators??What happens when QAnon, a sprawling pro-Trump conspiracy theory, is amplified by people with real political power?

"There?s No Way Around It: Spending on Police in the US Is out of Control

By Joe Rangore

Sunday, July 6, 2015

A poll released Monday by DGA Americas found that one in four voters across the country still trust the US government.

The news was shared by other health organizations that released similar findings on the issue. Another Pew Research Center survey released last month found that 53 percent of Americans said they trust the US government and 82 percent said they trust the CDC.

But if ""Who Can Trust This?"" answered the question, perhaps an American might assume that the CDC is so poorly run that the public wants it closed down.

As Dr. John McTeague, executive director of the CDC, explains, when the US government ""absences safe medical practice that is essential to a healthy, prosperous country,"" it does so under the rubric of politicization.

""You don't have to fill a large public infrastructure or school complex,"" McTeague said. ""There are enormous resources, and things that impact public health. It's a tough story to wrap your head around, but to have this kind of political reaction it could hurt you economically. With a very large amount of budget in place, they create challenges for employers. It may make life harder for those people who provide the health care they need.

""If you had a law that banned teachers and judges from requiring different mental health issues, or called on the Department of Education to issue a set of standards, to how much it cost, what would that actually do to keep up with the costs of employment?"" McTeague said. ""What's the point? What's the cost? I mean, who wants to do a, look, sit there and figure out what's going to happen and do nothing about it. That's a really small piece of the large pie that comes with government when it comes to actually solving health care problems.""

"Al Sharpton: Defunding police is something ?a latte liberal' may like, but ?proper policing? is necessary. ?He's on the way to rebuild police force, with the moral support of President Obama??",machine
"Fox News contributor Kiron Skinner weighs in.In the wake of George Floyd'sÿdeath, calls to ""defund the police"" have in a matter of days escalated from a fringe campaign to a celebrity-backed cause to part of the municipal mainstream -- and now appearÿprimed to spur official action,ÿto varying degrees,ÿin cities across the country.The stunning momentum behind the movement has fueled Republican criticism that ""radical"" ideas are being readily embraced by Democrats.On the ground, however, there is a visible conflict between Democrats on board with ""defund"" and those who want to seek reforms without actually dismantling police departments. This split, and the sudden power that activists wield over local officials on the issue,ÿwas perhaps best illustrated over the weekend when Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey faced a crowd of protestersÿasking him whether he would support abolishing the city's police department.MINNEAPOLIS MAYOR JACOB FREY REJECTS CITY COUNCIL'S PUSH TO DEFUND POLICE, DESPITE VETO-PROOF MAJORITYFrey, while promising reform to the city's ""systemically racist"" policing system and saying ""the police union needs to be put in its place,"" was asked a ""yes or no"" question by a protester if he would ""commit to defunding the Minneapolis Police Department.""""We don't want no more police,"" the woman questioning him continued. ""Is that clear? We don't want people with guns toting around in our communities, shooting us down.""""I do not support the abolition"" of the police department, Frey said.He was immediately shouted down. ""Get the f---ÿout of here,"" the protester responded as others loudly booed Frey,ÿwho later reiterated his commitment to reforming the department, despite saying he would not dismantle it entirely.The movement, like protests across the country, is driven by anger over Floyd's death in the custody of the Minneapolis Police Department.Despite Frey's reluctance to go along,ÿMinneapolis? left-leaningÿCity Council members on Sunday announced a veto-proof push to disband theÿMinneapolis police.Supporters of the move told Fox News,ÿ?We recognize that we don?t have all the answers about what a police-free future looks like, but our community does. We?re committing to engaging with every willing community member in the city of Minneapolis over the next year to identify what safety looks like for you.?The calls for dismantling the city police are perhaps the loudest from City Council member Jeremiah Ellison, the son of state Attorney General Keith Ellison. The younger Ellison has said that after taking apart the police department, ""we?re not simply gonna glue it back together. We are going to dramatically rethink how we approach public safety and emergency response. It?s really past due.""What defunding the police looks like is different in various localities. In Minneapolis, theÿsupermajority of the city council seemingly supports a complete structural dismantling of the department. In other places, departments would remain in place but get less government resources, with some of their funding directed toward social justice programs.FREY BOOED OUT OF PROTEST AFTER REFUSING TO DEFUND COPS;ÿFREY TALKS TO FOX 9 AFTERWARDPresident Trump on Monday issued a broad condemnation of the ""defund"" push.""LAW & ORDER, NOT DEFUND AND ABOLISH THE POLICE. The Radical Left Democrats have gone Crazy!"" he tweeted.The Los Angeles Times reported last week that Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti plans to cut up to $150 million from that city's police department and redistribute the money to ""black communities and communities of color.""DEREK CHAUVIN SET TO MAKE FIRST COURT APPEARANCEMeanwhile, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced over the weekend that he would be diverting funding for the New York Police Department toward social services.?The details will be worked out in the budget process in the weeks ahead. But, I want people to understand that we are committed to shifting resources to ensure that the focus is on our young people,? de Blasio said.The movement is swiftly gaining mainstream acceptance, as illustrated by a ""Defund the police"" tweet from Brian Fallon, the former press secretary for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign who previously worked for then-President Barack Obama's justice department and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.But it's also garnered criticism from some on the right.""This is dangerous, counterproductive, and deeply irrational,"" Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, said in response to a news story on the Minneapolis movement.ÿ""'Defund the police'ÿis not a call from the fringes of the far left anymore. It has gone from a radical slogan to actual policy in a major American city, within days.""Calls for defunding the police are also coming in from politicians in Chicago, Portland, Ore., Washington, D.C. and more. Celebrities including Lizzo, John Legend and Jane Fonda have also jumped on the bandwagon, signing an open letter demanding police departments be defunded.The pressure from the movement has made politicians reluctant to commit even the slightest affront to those who are calling for the defunding of police.Washington, D.C., Mayor Murial Bowser on Friday dedicated ""Black Lives Matter Plaza"" on a street near the White House. Later, protesters added an equals sign and the words ""defund the police"" to the mural. When asked whether she would remove the unauthorized changes to her government's street mural on ABC's ""This Week,"" Bowser was noncommittal.OBAMAS, CELEBRITIES VOICE SUPPORT FOR GEORGE FLOYD DEMONSTRATORS IN VIRTUAL GRADUATION MESSAGE""We certainly are very proud of the D.C. mural that we commissioned and our department of public works and local artists installed. It is an affirmative piece of art,"" she said, not answering the host's question.When asked again, Bowser said, ""[i]t's not a part of the mural and we certainly encourage expression, but we are using the city streets for city art... I actually haven't had anÿopportunity to review it.""The Washington Post reported that on Sunday, city employees painted over the equals sign, which the protesters had originally made from a D.C. flag, but left the ""defund the police"" as is.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIn another example of the power of the movement, Democratic California state Sen. Scott Wiener was pressured last week by his left-wing opponent into swearing off contributions from police unions and donating them to charity. He did.But his opponent, Jackie Fielder, immediately countered that he was not going far enough, and could theoretically still accept contributions from organizations funded by police unions and that he was not giving back money he received from police unions as early as 2015.""No loopholes,"" Fielder, who has amplified calls saying Garcetti's proposed cuts to the Los Angeles Police Department budget aren't enough, said.Fox News' Peter Aitken contributed to this report.ÿ",human
"Protesters? Demands in Response to Police Brutality Have Come a Long Way Since the 1992 LA Rebellion
